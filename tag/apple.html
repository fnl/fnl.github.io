                    </h2>
                    
                    <p>It is a bit of an effort to install the latest <strong>numpy</strong> and <strong>scipy</strong>
libraries due to their dependencies on Fortran libraries, while Apple is
(was? ...) mostly neglecting all Fortran issues. Furthermore, when
trying to compile a collection of these libraries for Python 3k and 64
bit, all these headaches seem to magnify enough so that attempting to
use them with Py3k on OSX has to be very much discouraged by the author.
Getting NumPy to work on 64 bit with Py3k and playing nicely the various
&quot;high-level&quot; libraries and the R environment can become a nightmare on a
Mac. If you really need to use Py3k, but are married to OSX, you are
probably better off installing a virtual machine with your favorite
Linux distro than trying to get this ensemble to work natively. In other
words, OSX is not a good platform for scientific computing, and you are
living easier with what is available - unless you prefer spending your
time on tinkering over productivity. You have been warned…</p>
<p>This guide will outline how to install the following Python software
stack:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>NumPy (1.6.2)</li>
<li>SciPy (0.10.1)</li>
<li>MatPlotLib (1.2.0)</li>
<li>IPython (0.13.2)</li>
<li>Scikit-Learn (0.13)</li>
<li>RPy2 (2.3.2)</li>
</ul>
<p>Optional instructions to install the two &quot;new kids on the block&quot;,
Pandas and StatsModels, are provided, too. To get a 64 bit version of
all this software installed on OSX 10.6 through 10.8 that does work &quot;out
of the box&quot; (although admittedly not optimally due to the Fortran
issues!) without too much of a hassle, follow these steps:</p>
<div class="section" id="preparatory-setup">
<h2>Preparatory Setup</h2>
<p>It is assumed you are using <strong>distribute</strong> and <strong>pip</strong> to install
Python packages. This means, you need to have the following setup done
already:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
curl -O http://python-distribute.org/distribute\_setup.py
sudop python distribute\_setup.py
curl -O https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py
sudo python get-pip.py
</pre>
<p>Furthermore, we are assuming a 64 bit build of Python 2.7 as the
target environment. If you only need/want to use a stack compiled for a
32 bit architecture, simpler paths than the one laid out here might work
as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="numpy">
<h2><a class="reference external" href="http://www.numpy.org/">NumPy</a></h2>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/NumPy/">Download and install</a> a version of numpy that is not too new
(currently, 1.6 worked, while numpy-dev is at 1.8) for the latest
version of OSX and the oldest still supported version of Python
(currently, 2.7) to have any chance of success.</p>
<p>The &quot;newest&quot; NumPy package that was found to work was the numpy-1.6.2
package for Python 2.7, while when using any newer package, the
post-installation check in the Python interpreter:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; import numpy; numpy.test('full')
</pre>
<p>did not pass without errors. What you never want to be seeing are
errors directly related to the Fortran compiler. This would probably
mean that you have your own version of Fortran installed; The best
remedy in that case is to remove it and the tests should pass.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="scipy">
<h2><a class="reference external" href="http://www.scipy.org/SciPy">SciPy</a></h2>
<p>Again, <a class="reference external" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/scipy/files/scipy/">fetch a version</a> where not too many tests fail (and even on
Ubuntu LTS 12.04, the tests &quot;test_io.test_imread&quot; and &quot;test_expon&quot;
are known too fail and are considered to be a non-issue). On OSX 10.7
with Python 2.7, it is possible to install the 0.10.1 package and the
final:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; import scipy; scipy.test()
</pre>
<p>check passes with &quot;only&quot; 9 failures. If you use newer versions, more
tests will fail. In general, these two core libraries are the hardest
part and it is essential to get particularly NumPy installed correctly
for everything else to work.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="matplotlib">
<h2><a class="reference external" href="http://matplotlib.org/">MatPlotLib</a></h2>
<p>The next step is the installation of matplotlib; There are
<a class="reference external" href="http://matplotlib.org/downloads.html">pre-compiled OSX packages</a> for Python 2.7 available, and the latest
version (1.2.0 at the time of this writing) should work without any
trouble. To ensure the installation worked, try this in the Python
interpreter:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; from pylab import \*; plot([1,2,3]); show()
</pre>
<p>and you should see a plot with a straight diagonal. To ensure you have
the right library, also check:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; import matlpotlib; matplotlib.\_\_version\_\_
</pre>
<p>And you should see the desired version number you were trying to
install.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ipython">
<h2><a class="reference external" href="http://ipython.org/">IPython</a></h2>
<p>First of all, a different readline installation is necessary:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
sudo easy\_install-2.7 readline
</pre>
<p>Note that readline has to be installed using easy_install, not pip!</p>
<p>Now, the default installation way should work and we can simply do:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
sudo pip install ipython[zmq,qtconsole,notebook,test]
</pre>
<p>To make sure the installation worked, execute the newly installed
iptest script.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="scikit-learn">
<h2><a class="reference external" href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/">Scikit-Learn</a></h2>
<p>This again is pretty straightforward; Do:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
sudo pip install scikit-learn
nosetests sklearn --exe
</pre>
<p>This nosetest will produce one (and only one) error: &quot;Split arrays or
matrices into random train and test subsets&quot;. But <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/1648">according to the
developer</a>, this is a non-issue and can be ignored.</p>
<p>Last, if you are interested in using two more experimental and novel
libraries on Python that are attempting to rid the requirement of using
R (and/or rpy), you might want to install Pandas and StatsModels. If you
prefer non-experimental, production stable libraries, you are probably
advised to use R and RPy2, as RPy (&quot;version 1&quot;) often tends to have
issues.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pandas">
<h2><a class="reference external" href="http://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a></h2>
<p>(Python Data Analysis Library) Again, the default installation route
should work:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
sudo pip install pandas
</pre>
<p>To ensure the library is operational, run (should not produce any
errors):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
nosetests pandas
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="statsmodels">
<h2><a class="reference external" href="http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/">StatsModels</a></h2>
<p>As with Pandas, we can use the &quot;default installation pathway&quot;, but
need to first install an undocumented dependency for this module
(patsy):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
sudo pip install patsy
sudo pip install statsmodels
</pre>
<p>To check the installation worked, open a Python interpreter session
and do:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; import statsmodels.api as sm
&gt;&gt;&gt; sm.test()
</pre>
<p>Here, several tests seem to be failing and it is not clear at all if
this is expected or not. StatsModels has several hundreds of open issues
and should probably be considered very experimental at this stage.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rpy2">
<h2><a class="reference external" href="http://rpy.sourceforge.net/">RPy2</a></h2>
<p>Again, the standard installation works (assuming you have R itself
installed already, at least!):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
sudo pip install rpy2
</pre>
<p>To ensure the install worked, run the tests as:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
python -m 'rpy2.tests'
</pre>
<p>You should not be seeing any problems.</p>
<p><em>E voilà</em> - you now have a fully functioning environment for running
all kinds and sorts of statistical data analyses and machine learning
algorithms!</p>

                        <a href="http://fnl.es/mobileme-vs-sugarsync-vs-dropbox.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to &quot;MobileMe vs. SugarSync vs. DropBox&quot;">MobileMe vs. SugarSync vs. DropBox</a>
                    </h2>
                    
                    <p>I now have tested MobileMe, SugarSync, and DropBox for quite a while to
decide which service to buy for syncing my “electronic life” between my
Macs (soon I’ll be managing two OSX Server blades, one Mini, and two
MBPs!). After this period, there is no doubt to me: I’m syncing my iCal
calendars and Address Book content via Google, my bookmarks with XMarks,
and everything else via DropBox.</p>
<p>MobileMe’s iDisk is nothing more than a pain and a piece of junk, which
I honestly did not expect. After all the problems they had last year
launching Me.com, I thought they would have by now created a working
service. But the iDisk and syncing my PIM (Personal Information Manager
- I still use Yojimbo, as Evernote’s and Together’s handling of
encryption are pure patched add-ons) was just a [bad] joke: You even
need to buy extra software if you want to do file syncing, as iDisk’s
“offline” sync is so slow and error prone I could not believe Apple
dares to offer something like that. So you need to either use Lingon and
rsync to sync to your online mode iDisk which doesn’t win a medal for
simplicity, or buy something like ChronoSync - and that takes hours
(!!!) to ensure 10 GB of data in about 30-40k Files are synced, <strong>every
time</strong>. All the more, ChronoSync may be the fastest and safest syncer in
the wild! What finally got me mad was the sync agent using 90% CPU all
of the time, at times virtually locking you out of your own machine,
while performing almost nothing. Finally, if you ever try to navigate
that online iDisk, get yourself a cup of tea, you will have plenty of
time to drink it up until that file is open…</p>
<p>Compared to SugarSync, DropBox with its simplicity and real versioning
of files is significantly better performing than SugarSync, espcially if
we talk upload and real volume, and if you ever tried SugarSync, it is a
resource hugger (not as bad as iDisk, but it will stop your workflow).
So in the end the choice for me was based on “mutual exclusion”, there
is simply still no service that can hold the candle to DropBox - and
just got me Pro account. As I am writing this, I am syncing up dozens of
gigs of data to my 50 GB DropBox, and I hardly notice it happening!</p>
<p>Oh, if you get yourself an account for DropBox, either the free 2 GB or
a full Pro account, I would appreciate if you register via <a class="reference external" href="https://www.getdropbox.com/referrals/NTE0NTA0OTk">this link</a>,
as it creates me some 500 MB extra space for referring you :o).</p>

                    <p>As everyone has one, I just thought I might as well also put together
my personal list of the most useful applications for your nifty Mac
running the one and only truly user-friendly, working windowed OS: X!
The lists are ordered by importance, some apps are non-free, but I
explain why I use them and why you might want to as well.</p>
<div class="section" id="system-tools">
<h2>System Tools</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/">Quicksilver</a> - application launcher, action and command window -
THE most important app to have on any Mac, just get it (and learn to
use it...).</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://free.abracode.com/cmworkshop/">OnMyCommand</a> - custom right click context menus. Great tool, I use
it for a tons of stuff from SVN repository interaction, file settings
and archiving, to things like &quot;select a Madrid address to
automatically open the location in Google maps&quot; or &quot;translate the
selected text to English/Spanish.&quot;</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://cyberduck.ch/">Cyberduck</a> - is a great FTP/SFTP client, if you need one - and
definitely more elegant than using Finder...</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="editors">
<h2>Editors</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://aquamacs.org/">Aquamacs</a> - is the one-in-all solution and my favorite emacs port
for the Mac. Although, I only use it for LisP and C programming now,
as I have TextMate (see below) for my Python and web development as
well as simple text editing.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.uoregon.edu/%7Ekoch/texshop/">TexShop</a> - is the most comfortable WYSINWYG (what you see is NOT
what you get...) editor for LaTeX, which is the most reliable and
stable environment to write books and papers. Yet, you naturally just
can keep editing your TeX in emacs/Aquamacs...</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.macromates.com/">TextMate</a> - editor is kinda cool in some senses, but has some
drawbacks: first, it ain't free - I have it because my research
institute bought a license for me without even asking. It doesn't
know LisP and C. Most features it has you can have with emacs or (if
things would come to worst) write them with ELisP for emacs instead
of learning the TM macro commands. Yet, some things are kinda cool,
especially the filebrowser and codebrowser I prefer over the emacs
Speedbar. It is great for Python, Ruby, XML, Perl, JavaScript and SVN
interaction (if you are damned to program Java, use Eclipse...). So
that, incredibly fast startup, and decent column selection (you can
have that in emacs with a plug, too!) are my reasons for using it. If
you are willing to spend the bucks, get it. If you want an all-in-one
solution stick with some emacs.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="getting-things-done">
<h2>Getting Things Done</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.barebones.com/products/yojimbo/">Yojimbo</a> - if you are only willing to spend money on just one
single application, this is it. This is sort of a multi-functional
archiver: it stores your serial numbers, passwords, credit card
details, invoices, interesting documents, webpages and pdfs, the
metro plan of your city - whatever, you name it. Stuff is properly
encrypted using AES for protection. You can sort, tag, file your
content in a very decent way and you actually get to immediately find
the information again. This thing should be standard in any OS X
distribution, makes life so much simpler.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://journler.com/">Journler</a> - is a nice diary to keep track of what you are doing and
your ideas about it. I use it as my development diary (&quot;lab journal&quot;
would be the term, I guess...). You can add all sorts of media to
your entries (videos, sound (voice recordings!), images) and even
upload your entries to your blog. Cool!</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://bargiel.home.pl/iGTD/">iGTD</a> - yet another GettingThingsDone client - if you are in a
situation like me and have 10k things in your head and another 10k
todos, this is what helps you keeping track of what's next.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.apple.com/iwork/keynote/">Keynote</a> - from the iWork package; if you need to do presentations:
please do not try to infest your gorgeous Mac with crap software from
Redmond. Do your presentations with Keynote - their just better,
nicer and more aesthetic.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="media">
<h2>Media</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/">VideoLANClient (VLC)</a> - the media player for the Mac: no more
problems with missing audio/video codes, plays (almost) everything
and allows full screen for free (a two thumbs down on QuickTime for
this one!).</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.getdemocracy.com/">Democracy</a> - player, the most fun way to handle, download and
archive your video collection from YouTube, Yahoo! and Google Video,
Blogdigger, et al. as well as any clips, vids and movies you have
locally. Supports full screen viewing for free (as opposed to
QuickTime...), but ain't as versatile with codecs as VLC - but you
can teach Democracy to launch those vids in VLC.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/download/">iTunes</a> - is a must have if you own an iPod (or, eventually, an
iPhone...). If not, it is still the coolest way to keep track of your
podcasts, radio stations and browse your local MP3s (covers).</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/iphoto/">iPhoto</a> - should come with your Mac anyway AFAIK. The most
practical way of staying on top of your ever-growing picture and
image collection while integrating nicely with other apps (like
Keynote, Journler and many others).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="safari-plugins">
<h2>Safari Plugins</h2>
<p>If you are just such a Cocoa-fan as me, and prefer browsing with
Safari over Firefox (yes, OK, decent web development can only be done
with the fox, so you do need it anyway in this case...) here are some
plugs. There are some reasons to use Safari: integrates websites from
your Address Book into your Bookmarks, your bookmarks are system-wide
searchable, you can aggregate feeds very nicely, pushing URLs (weblocs)
to other apps is easy are just some. UPDATE: now back to the Fox again,
the plugins for it just rule! UPDATE (2008): and to Safari - high-speed,
nicest rendering of all browsers and WebKit rule even more!</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.kottke.org/05/02/saft-safari-plugin">Saft</a> - is the only plugin I can recommend to buy. And if only for
the full screen mode. This is just so much cooler than even the
crappy IExploder 7 full screen mode, as it actually intelligently
hides what you do not want to see currently (status bar, booksmarks,
URL bar). Naturally, it has tons of other features, too - check it
out.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.inquisitorx.com/safari/">Inquisitor</a> - is the coolest enhancement for the (Google) search
box and possibly the best free plugin. Just get it.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://pimpmysafari.com/plugins/safariblock-112">SafariBlock</a> - is a good way to block images, popups and frames you
don't wanna see. Not as powerful as Pith or Saft, but a free
alternative.</li>
</ul>
