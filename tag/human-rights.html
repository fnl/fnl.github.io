                    </h2>

                    <p>The recent reports on renditions of terrorism suspects have reached an
alarming rate. Compare what happened during the middle ages and what is
occurring now again with slightly different circumstances:</p>
<p>If you have one of these characteristics, you might be a
witch/<em>terrorist</em>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Red/<em>Dark</em> hair,</li>
<li>green/<em>dark</em> eyes,</li>
<li>female/<em>non-caucasian</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are considered a “target” by these traits, you can be
“rightfully” tortured by the inquisition/secret service.</p>
<p>Governments worldwide, including most likely yours, are actively
ignoring our most basic rights in the name of “safety”. More and more
people are disappearing into “black sites”, tortured and ill-treated for
years and years - at levels where even the inquisition was not as bad as
compared to what is happening here and now, today. On the other hand, we
Japanese, EU, and US citizens have fought for so many centuries to
arrive at a status where everybody should understand the necessity for
human rights, free speech, etc.. It took two world wars and millions of
deaths to realize these trivial facts. Now governments are openly taking
away your rights from you again, trying to tell you they are
“protecting” you from a threat that virtually does not exist. And even
if it would exist, it does not give anybody the right to destroy the
life of any living person at their very foundations. If you do not act
now, you are either yourself approving that anybody, including you, may
be tortured for the sake of “security”, or are ignorant enough to
believe this will simply “go away” again some day.</p>
<p>Please, do not let this continue; do not let humanity fall back into a
state that could be even worse than the middle ages. Any day you spend
not protesting against these inhuman and useless acts of random force
against humanity you are indirectly killing and torturing, too. Any day
this continues, your rights will deteriorate.</p>
<p>If you do not protest or voice your opinion, you are indirectly
granting the governments of this world with the right to kill and
torture people at will. If you do not raise your voice, you, too, are
part of this machinery, killing and torturing because your silence is
set equal to agreeing to your government's actions in a democratic
world. Act now, and raise your voice against this madness - while we
still have the right of freedom of speech (or do we?).</p>
<p>POST-EDIT: On an interesting side note, the only <a class="reference external" href="http://www.petitiononline.com/stoper/petition.html">petition where anybody
worldwide can sign</a>, has exactly 139 signees at the time of this
writing. How sad…</p>
<p>POST-POST-EDIT: At least, there is an Amnesty International page against
Guantanamo Bay and illegal US torture <a class="reference external" href="http://www.tearitdown.org/">here</a>, which almost 140,000
people have signed so far - even though I think it should be dozens of
millions if humans were capable of using their head…</p>
<p>POST-3-EDIT: And another very good video from AI published yesterday on
the subject: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/video-and-audio/no-justification-for-torture-20080626">Torture can never be justified</a>.</p>
