                    </h2>
                    
                    <p>Obviously, from the huge gap between this and my last post you probably
already have imagined, mine was quite busy. To sum it up: I went to
Canada, then Mayte - that is my gorgeous girlfriend in case you still
don’t know! - was in Madrid for a whole month (happy me!!!) ad we went
to Tarragona, a city to the south of Barcelona, and to Bilbao. Finally,
I had to prepare for a talk in Turku, Finland, which was the last
“station” for me this summer.</p>
<p>First things first, I’ll start with the Canada trip. This was more or
less all payed by my institute because I went to the world’s largest
bioinformatics conference, the ISMB in Toronto, to present my
<a class="reference external" href="http://bcms.bioinfo.cnio.es">BioCreative MetaServer</a> project the first time. Reception was quite
good, and my boss and I were both quite happy. The hotel we stayed at,
although expensive, was rather crappy: The second day we got back, a
colleague of mine found another guy in his room, just taking a shower!
After some inquiries at the desk, they could not “determine” how the
mistake happend and the manager went up with my friend to clear the
matters up. The guy there the even refused to change the room! So my
friend finally decided to do the only logic thing and moved to another
room… Nice hotel, especially considering we were paying almost Can$ 200
a night! The city of Toronto itself is very US-like, with skyscrapers
and a downtown that gets all crappy and full of homeless people during
the night. I also was kind of annoyed by the way people act there -
everyone is just a bit too friendly for my taste, it seems more like a
show than for real. Finally, the city surely is cosy in winter: all the
center is connected with tunnels so you do never have to go outside -
brr, that makes me freeze just thinking of it! Another funny thing:
while we were there, the largest bike theft ever was going on; later the
police caught a bike seller stealing most of them - they found a whole
2,800 (!!!) bikes in his home, his shop, and in various garages he had
to rent to store all those bikes!</p>
<p>Mayte’s stay here without doubt was my personal highlight this summer,
and maybe even this year: she found a way to be here a whole month,
which we spent together almost every day (well, at least the nights…).
It will be a while before we can spend that much time together in a row
again! Anyways, apart from some good going out to “terrazas”, bars and
fancy night clubs here in Madrid, getting some even better dancing done
and listening to the latest electronic beats, we also did two trips to
the north of Spain and had a nice afternoon one weekend getting out of
the city sprawl and enjoying the great countryside - of which you can
ascertain yourself in the photos below. We went to Tarragona together
with Iris and Gonzalo to a Spa-Hotel with all sorts nice luxury like
Saunas, swimming pools, baths, massages, golf course, etc. and had a
very nice and relaxed weekend while celebrating Iris’ birthday. Actually
this is a really special occasion, as Iris usually loves to be with many
people and gives great parties with very many people (and nice Spanish
and Mexican girls … not that it would be any of my business nowadays!).
The second trip we made to Bilbao, enjoying the great landscape there,
making the obligatory - and worth while! - visit to the Guggenheim, as
well as having a heavy night out during the opening of the Semana
Grande, which had spectacular fireworks. While we were sitting in the
grass watching the fireworks, a group standing next to us with two guys
and a girl was watching just as delighted - when suddenly a really huge
explosion filled the whole sky above us in a startling view of little
stars falling down from the sky. The girl got rather frightened, jumped,
and ran a bit, when she finally just ducked “for cover” on the grass. I
admit it was not nice of us, but we had to laugh. Then her boyfriend
turned his head toward her and with a very nonchalant voice asked: “Que
tienes?” (“What’s up with you?” - “Was hast’n?”). The somewhat
frightened girlfriend returned to his side, while we keept giggling
every other time a huge rocket exploded and she started to make leeway…
Well, apart from that we had a great breakfast, too, with champagne and
caviar, of which I am sorry to say, I cannot give details. So, this city
is really worth a visit, especially if you have a person along who knows
her way around town, the bars, and the beaches. One day the time was
ripe for Mayte to go back, and I finally gave up my plans of taking here
hostage and let her go back - and now she is happy and far away from all
the bourgeois western world in South America… Man, do I miss her
company!</p>
<p>The third and final trip this summer was going to Turku. What, you
really do not know what or where Turku is? No worries, I didn’t either.
To be honest, it took me some time to find an acceptable travel route to
that place… But every Turku inhabitant will quickly assure you that you
missed out on history: it was, until about a hundred years ago, the
capital of Finland, and is also the oldest town to be found in that part
of the world. So, you might be asking yourself quite rightfully,
what-the-hell was I doing in such a remote location? Well, I was
attending a text-mining conference there: the SMBM’08 (Semantic Mining
in Biomedicine) and was giving an almost one hour long presentation
about my platform. So you can imagine it took my quite some time to
prepare the talk and the data to present, and, as I never had given a
talk of that length, quite some cups of tea (thanks to a tip from
Mayte!) before the talk to keep me calm. As a result, I had the feeling
the presentation was quite some success and the response from the
audience more than good. Anyhow, the “real” success will have to be
measured when seeing how many new participants I could attract to the
platform with this presentation - time will tell! Apart from work, we
had a great boat tour through the hundreds of tiny islands along the
coast, went to a Finish smoke Sauna with heated baths - you cool
yourself of by jumping into the (very cold) sea! - and a great dinner.
This had a rather funny ending, when the organizers fooled around with
me: there was a quiz about Finish wildlife, which I apparently won. They
gave me a bottle filled with transparent liquid and some finish text
explaining the contents. Without much thought I assumed it was vodka and
immediately got some shot glasses and shared the bottle with the
conference attendants. Much to our surprise, it did not have the taste
of vodka, but was a special kind of water extracted from birch trees… I
guess, I have to rethink my attitude about alcohol! As for the Finish
people themselves, there are some quite notable things: first of, it
really is true, they are blond, almost all of them! Second, and I really
was quite astonished, I never met that many friendly - and really
friendly, not that artificial stuff you find in the US and Canada -
people in any country before. The only thing why I think they are
slightly crazy occurred to me when, while walking through town at about
15 ˚C, with jackets and long pants, we passed by an outdoor, public
swimming pool: it was full of Fins “simulating” that it still was
summer!</p>
<p>Well, I am sure I forgot to cover some stuff, but then the post is
already long enough as it is. To all of you, have a nice autumn,
enjoying the last rays of sun - if you do not live in Spain!</p>

                <div class="post">
                    <h2 class="title">
                        <a href="http://www.fnl.es/amazonas-101.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to &quot;Amazonas 101&quot;">Amazonas 101</a>
                    </h2>
                    
                    <p>Colombia is one of the most magnificent countries I have been so far.
If you know a tiny bit of its history with all the bloody civil wars
which have been almost continuously tormenting the country since the
40s, it is more than astonishing to find that the people themselves are
very open and friendly. The lush green on the countryside and the
amazing beaches on the coasts, mixed with some really high mountain
peaks allow for a variety you will not find in many other countries.
Finally, as it is next to the equator, the climate is almost all year
round the same: warm and mostly sunny (well, Bogotá is at 2,600 ASL, so
bring a warm jacket for the capital...).</p>
<p>The current president, Uribe, is sending military forces everywhere in
the country to protect the civilians and tourists from attacks from
guerilla and paramilitary groups. Although you might not agree that this
is the best solution to the problem, you have to admit that he so far is
probably the most successful president in terms of restoring relative
security - at the great price of sacrificing the peoples personal
freedom, obviously; Colombia probably never has been as safe in the past
few decades as it is now - and it has by far less hostage-takings per
year as most uninformed people would make you believe (by now, something
below 600 per year). In my travels, I never felt more unsafe than in any
place in Europe - at least if you learn to ignore that at every second
corner you see a small group of military personnel or police.</p>
<p>Both major cities I visited, Bogotá and Cartagena, are really nice
cities - although the crazy traffic and taxi drivers in Bogotá can make
you feel a little ill to you stomach... Especially Cartagena is really
worth the visit, the old town being built in a style slightly similar to
the houses in Extremadura (Spain) - and not without reason probably,
as most Conquistadores came from this region of Spain. Yet, the bright
colors and plenty of flowers and green give the town a very unique and
lovely look. Last but not least, Cartagena is on the Caribbean coast and
therefore you have plenty of wonderful beaches to choose to spend your
day. On a general advice: usually, you take boats to get to those
beaches, which leave from the town center. Insist, really, to be taken
there by a tiny private boat (not more than 20 or so passengers) and do
not take one of the big ships: it cuts your beach stay in half, you are
dumped at a super-touristic aquarium nobody seemed interested in anyway,
and spend the boat time with hundreds of Colombian families (including
everything from grandmother to great-grand child). Not that it was my
worst experience ever, but there are more fun ways to waste your time...</p>
<p>The major part of our travels - with my [now (*kiss*)] girlfriend
Mayte and two of her friends from Portugal and Spain, Xana and Ivan - we
spent in the Amazons. It is hard to describe the experience of visiting
the jungle, but if you have been to a real desert, on top of high
mountains or glaciers, or other really strange places, you know what I
am talking about. The biodiversity is so amazing you will never be able
to go back to a zoo or botanic garden without a knowing smile on your
face. I have no idea how many different plants I saw - including the
Victoria amazonica, the largest lotus in the world - but when one of our
guides was telling us about which plant heals what while in the jungle,
I got the impression of walking though a pharmacy... The animal life is
just as amazing: alligators, snakes, birds in all varieties and kinds,
spiders, sloths, insects of all sizes, piranhas (we even caught our own
- but as far as I can tell, it took us more chicken meat to catch them
than they yielded...), even dolphins (which get a pink tint when they
hunt because of their circulation - a really unique view) - plus another
few dozen or so I have missed to list here.</p>
<p>Moving around the jungle might seem tough and dangerous at first - and
I make a bet it is, if you try to move cross-country straight through
the jungle for days. We were not intending to do that - we were moving
along the Amazonas river only - and always had at least a hut to sleep
in, with beds and mosquito nets in the most &quot;extreme&quot; cases. Most of the
time we spent in villages and towns (Leticia -&gt; Puerto Nariño [a little
jewel in the Colombian Amazons and a must visit] -&gt; Leticia/Tabatinga -&gt;
and Manaus) in hotels, where you do not even need to use mosquito nets.
The greatest danger is you doing something stupid on your own. The
interested might want an advice on what to bring, so I'd suggest to
pack:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>lots of insect repellent (we used Relec extra fuerte, about 1 bottle
[100 mL each] per person and week),</li>
<li>a light rain protection (if it rains really heavy - which it does
more or less every morning - just forget protection... this is more
against the wind and on boats),</li>
<li>some long-sleeves and long pants (protection against sun and/or while
hiking in the jungle),</li>
<li>decent (!) hiking shoes,</li>
<li>very strong sun protection (factor 40 or more - I used 60!),</li>
<li>a towel (no, this is no Hitchhikers Guide joke :-) - preferentially,
one of those micro-towels to save space and weight),</li>
<li>a flashlight,</li>
<li>a small first aid kit with antibiotics against diarrhea, pills to
dampen fever and Malaria effects (Ibuprofen 600, Malaron - just in
case - I strongly advise against taking those Malaria pills on the
trip as prevention if you do not go jungle-trekking for many days!
The side effects are rather ugly, and actually the pills only reduce
the effects of Malaria, they do not really help prevent it.),</li>
<li>Suero (salt &amp; electrolytes) powder, and a lots of it! This protects you
from dehydrating and diarrhea; My friends all laughed at me for
drinking a liter of it a day (it tastes rather ugly), but I was the
only of our group to not have to spend a day on the pot in the end...</li>
<li>a very light (I used silk) sleeping bag, and</li>
<li>something to pass time (books, card games, etc. - hey, it's Colombia,
no need to be in a hurry).</li>
</ul>
<p>On a final shout-out: many thanks to my amazing travel companions (aka
&quot;los pendejos/tottos&quot;...) and some very special ones to the most
gorgeous girl in the world that I am more than just happy to have become
close with during this trip: You provided me with one of the most
exciting trips I ever have made in my life!</p>

                    </h2>
                    
                    <p>In the last few weeks I had been to Cadiz and Almeria, both in
the south of Spain. Well, actually I was in none of those cities, but in
places close by.</p>
<p>The first trip together with Gema was down to Cadiz, about 30 km south
of the city some of Gemas friends were renting a flat in <a class="reference external" href="http://maps.google.es/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Conil,+Spain&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=11&amp;om=1">Conil</a>, a
village nearby. South of Cadiz you basically find the probably most
beautiful beaches of Spain, at least that was my impression and what my
Spanish friends told me (and, on a side note, the most incredible amount
of beautiful girls, too...). The only downside is that it can be kind of
windy, but if you know it, just bring some very stable wind protection,
and you should be fine. Actually, the one day it was windy, I was quite
happy, because with the burning sun having a swim and then cooling in
the breeze is a real relief. We also visited Tarifa, one of the main
wind- and kite surfing sites of Europe. You never saw a village so small
just full of surf shops - if you ask me, more dense than the skiing
shops in the tourist-trap villages in Tirol. Also we spent some time in
Los Caños de Meca, right between Conil and Tarifa, which is a real hippy
town and has a cool bar which is made up a bit like a ship deck and is
above a cliff looking out over the Atlantic. Great place to have some
&quot;copas&quot; (drinks)! On our way back to Madrid we took the time to stop in
Cordoba, which might be, together with Sevilla, the hottest (in
temperature, man!) town of Spain. In the center you can visit an
enormous (like in really enormous) mosque, as Cordoba and Granade where
interchangeably the capitals of the Arabian empire during the medieval
ages. Now it houses several (!!!) churches inside and it is really worth
paying the 8 Euros entry. Gema was slightly angry about my cultural
blasphemy, as the first thing that came to my mind upon entering was
&quot;and where is Indiana Jones?&quot;...</p>
<p>The second trip to Almeria in the southeast corner of Spain was
actually for a festival, the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.creamfields-andalucia.com/">Creamfields</a> in Spain. This festival is
exclusively for electronic music, and the lineup were bands and DJs like
Basement Jaxx, The Prodigy, or John Digweed. It's a 14 h festival
&quot;only&quot;, starting at 6 pm and lasting until about 8 am the next morning.
But believe me, that was by far enough for me, and it took me several
days to recover... The greatest thing about this location is that you
have the After Hour right smack on the beach, hanging out in the sun and
taking an occasional bath to cool down. Although it was great, I am not
sure to recommend it again: This year they had 50k visitors, and the
only access is a single little road, which meant we were jamming 2 1/2 h
in the car just to get in, and then another 1/2 h walk from the parking
place to the actual festival. Considering that they have more attendees
every year, I don't want to know how bad it will be next year. So if you
feel like going, I might recommend you come a day earlier and put up
tent there on the beach (actually, better in the wood at the side of the
beach - if you can't imagine why, just do as I recommend...).</p>
<p>So, all in all, two really gorgeous trips around Spain, and I am
looking forward to some more in the days to come this year. The only
thing I could slap my ass for is that I on both occasions forgot to
bring my camera...</p>
