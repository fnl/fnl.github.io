                    </h2>

                    <p>It is a bit of an effort to install the latest <strong>numpy</strong> and <strong>scipy</strong>
libraries due to their dependencies on Fortran libraries, while Apple is
(was? ...) mostly neglecting all Fortran issues. Furthermore, when
trying to compile a collection of these libraries for Python 3k and 64
bit, all these headaches seem to magnify enough so that attempting to
use them with Py3k on OSX has to be very much discouraged by the author.
Getting NumPy to work on 64 bit with Py3k and playing nicely the various
&quot;high-level&quot; libraries and the R environment can become a nightmare on a
Mac. If you really need to use Py3k, but are married to OSX, you are
probably better off installing a virtual machine with your favorite
Linux distro than trying to get this ensemble to work natively. In other
words, OSX is not a good platform for scientific computing, and you are
living easier with what is available - unless you prefer spending your
time on tinkering over productivity. You have been warned…</p>
<p>This guide will outline how to install the following Python software
stack:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>NumPy (1.6.2)</li>
<li>SciPy (0.10.1)</li>
<li>MatPlotLib (1.2.0)</li>
<li>IPython (0.13.2)</li>
<li>Scikit-Learn (0.13)</li>
<li>RPy2 (2.3.2)</li>
</ul>
<p>Optional instructions to install the two &quot;new kids on the block&quot;,
Pandas and StatsModels, are provided, too. To get a 64 bit version of
all this software installed on OSX 10.6 through 10.8 that does work &quot;out
of the box&quot; (although admittedly not optimally due to the Fortran
issues!) without too much of a hassle, follow these steps:</p>
<div class="section" id="preparatory-setup">
<h2>Preparatory Setup</h2>
<p>It is assumed you are using <strong>distribute</strong> and <strong>pip</strong> to install
Python packages. This means, you need to have the following setup done
already:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
curl -O http://python-distribute.org/distribute\_setup.py
sudop python distribute\_setup.py
curl -O https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py
sudo python get-pip.py
</pre>
<p>Furthermore, we are assuming a 64 bit build of Python 2.7 as the
target environment. If you only need/want to use a stack compiled for a
32 bit architecture, simpler paths than the one laid out here might work
as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="numpy">
<h2><a class="reference external" href="http://www.numpy.org/">NumPy</a></h2>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/NumPy/">Download and install</a> a version of numpy that is not too new
(currently, 1.6 worked, while numpy-dev is at 1.8) for the latest
version of OSX and the oldest still supported version of Python
(currently, 2.7) to have any chance of success.</p>
<p>The &quot;newest&quot; NumPy package that was found to work was the numpy-1.6.2
package for Python 2.7, while when using any newer package, the
post-installation check in the Python interpreter:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; import numpy; numpy.test('full')
</pre>
<p>did not pass without errors. What you never want to be seeing are
errors directly related to the Fortran compiler. This would probably
mean that you have your own version of Fortran installed; The best
remedy in that case is to remove it and the tests should pass.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="scipy">
<h2><a class="reference external" href="http://www.scipy.org/SciPy">SciPy</a></h2>
<p>Again, <a class="reference external" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/scipy/files/scipy/">fetch a version</a> where not too many tests fail (and even on
Ubuntu LTS 12.04, the tests &quot;test_io.test_imread&quot; and &quot;test_expon&quot;
are known too fail and are considered to be a non-issue). On OSX 10.7
with Python 2.7, it is possible to install the 0.10.1 package and the
final:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; import scipy; scipy.test()
</pre>
<p>check passes with &quot;only&quot; 9 failures. If you use newer versions, more
tests will fail. In general, these two core libraries are the hardest
part and it is essential to get particularly NumPy installed correctly
for everything else to work.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="matplotlib">
<h2><a class="reference external" href="http://matplotlib.org/">MatPlotLib</a></h2>
<p>The next step is the installation of matplotlib; There are
<a class="reference external" href="http://matplotlib.org/downloads.html">pre-compiled OSX packages</a> for Python 2.7 available, and the latest
version (1.2.0 at the time of this writing) should work without any
trouble. To ensure the installation worked, try this in the Python
interpreter:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; from pylab import \*; plot([1,2,3]); show()
</pre>
<p>and you should see a plot with a straight diagonal. To ensure you have
the right library, also check:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; import matlpotlib; matplotlib.\_\_version\_\_
</pre>
<p>And you should see the desired version number you were trying to
install.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ipython">
<h2><a class="reference external" href="http://ipython.org/">IPython</a></h2>
<p>First of all, a different readline installation is necessary:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
sudo easy\_install-2.7 readline
</pre>
<p>Note that readline has to be installed using easy_install, not pip!</p>
<p>Now, the default installation way should work and we can simply do:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
sudo pip install ipython[zmq,qtconsole,notebook,test]
</pre>
<p>To make sure the installation worked, execute the newly installed
iptest script.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="scikit-learn">
<h2><a class="reference external" href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/">Scikit-Learn</a></h2>
<p>This again is pretty straightforward; Do:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
sudo pip install scikit-learn
nosetests sklearn --exe
</pre>
<p>This nosetest will produce one (and only one) error: &quot;Split arrays or
matrices into random train and test subsets&quot;. But <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/1648">according to the
developer</a>, this is a non-issue and can be ignored.</p>
<p>Last, if you are interested in using two more experimental and novel
libraries on Python that are attempting to rid the requirement of using
R (and/or rpy), you might want to install Pandas and StatsModels. If you
prefer non-experimental, production stable libraries, you are probably
advised to use R and RPy2, as RPy (&quot;version 1&quot;) often tends to have
issues.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pandas">
<h2><a class="reference external" href="http://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a></h2>
<p>(Python Data Analysis Library) Again, the default installation route
should work:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
sudo pip install pandas
</pre>
<p>To ensure the library is operational, run (should not produce any
errors):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
nosetests pandas
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="statsmodels">
<h2><a class="reference external" href="http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/">StatsModels</a></h2>
<p>As with Pandas, we can use the &quot;default installation pathway&quot;, but
need to first install an undocumented dependency for this module
(patsy):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
sudo pip install patsy
sudo pip install statsmodels
</pre>
<p>To check the installation worked, open a Python interpreter session
and do:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; import statsmodels.api as sm
&gt;&gt;&gt; sm.test()
</pre>
<p>Here, several tests seem to be failing and it is not clear at all if
this is expected or not. StatsModels has several hundreds of open issues
and should probably be considered very experimental at this stage.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rpy2">
<h2><a class="reference external" href="http://rpy.sourceforge.net/">RPy2</a></h2>
<p>Again, the standard installation works (assuming you have R itself
installed already, at least!):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
sudo pip install rpy2
</pre>
<p>To ensure the install worked, run the tests as:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
python -m 'rpy2.tests'
</pre>
<p>You should not be seeing any problems.</p>
<p><em>E voilà</em> - you now have a fully functioning environment for running
all kinds and sorts of statistical data analyses and machine learning
algorithms!</p>

                    </h2>

                    <p>This change in Python 3.0 might be more than useful for
anybody intending to write programs that use more than the ASCII
characters (A-z, 0-9, and some symbols), which, given how i18n'ed most
applications are today, is rather the norm than the exception. I also
hope to encourage my fellow Pythoneers to update to 3.0 as soon as
humanly possible, not only because of this change, but because of the
general advantages of Python 3.0 (aka &quot;no-where near 3000&quot;...).</p>
<p>In case you do not understand the difference between Unicode and String
arrays, here is a short paragraph to get you started. A String (str in
pre-3.0 Python, bytes/bytearray in Python 3.x+) is a byte-array already
<em>bound</em> to a specific character-lookup table (e.g. ASCII, Latin-1,
UTF-8, etc.) to find the correct representation for that String. Note
that this is not the <em>glyph</em> itself you see on-screen, as this depends
on, e.g., what font you are using, and is handled by the GUI toolkit or
the terminal. A Unicode array (unicode in pre-3.0, str in 3.x+) on the
other hand is an array of &quot;universal&quot; bytes, so-called <strong>code-points</strong>
usually managed as two-byte arrays, but has no native representation.
Therefore, to create something readable from an Unicode object, you have
to <em>encode</em> its bytes by using a codetable, such as ASCII or UTF-16, to
the correct String representation (&quot;<em>bind</em> the Unicode array to a code
table&quot;). On the contrary, to create a Unicode array from a String array,
you need to <em>decode</em> (&quot;unbind&quot;) the String's coding to get the
&quot;universal&quot; (in quotation marks as not all programming langues have to
use base 16 integers (aka hex, or two bytes)) Unicode. If you are not
used to thinking in these terms, a general tip for pre-3.0 Python: your
program should, when handling String input (SAX parsers for example
already do the conversion for you), convert it to Unicode (decode the
Strings), and when outputing your Unicode arrays, convert them back to
the desired String representation (encode them) - while working with
Unicode internally to avoid bugs and possible exploits. A (rather
stupid, but you can interpolate the danger, I hope) snippet from
Python's Unicode HOWTO might exemplify this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
def read_file(filename, encoding):
    if '/' in filename:
        raise ValueError(u&quot;'/' not allowed in filename&quot;)
    else:
        return open(filename.decode(encoding), 'r')
</pre>
<p>Looks good at first, but what about sending that function a String not
in any standard encoding? For example, the UTF-7 encoding for
u&quot;/etc/passwd&quot; is &quot;+AC8-etc+AC8-passwd&quot; - a nasty mistake if that file
is presented to a user... (the work-around in this trivial example is
obvious: just decode before the if-clause - or, even better, when the
string enters your program - and compare to u'/'). To summarize, in
Python (not so in C, for example!) a Unicode array consists of two-byte
elements (base 16 integers) called code-points, Strings are arrays of
bytes which are bound to a codetable that helps the Python interpreter
look up the bytes' character representations and send them to your
terminal or GUI. Unicode to String conversion is called encoding
(&quot;binding&quot;), String to Unicode conversion is decoding (&quot;unbinding&quot;). The
fact that, when using the Python shell, you see &quot;real&quot; characters for a
String or Unicode object is pure convenience and should not distract you
from how they truly work internally.</p>
<p>After this lengthy Unicode vs. String intro, the best news first: if you
can allow yourself the luxury to program with any Python version and are
not dependent on external libraries, Python 3.0 is just made for you:
The new native String object is always a Unicode representation, and the
default encoding chosen for representing your strings is UTF-8. In other
words, if you use Python 3.0 and are happy with UTF-8, you no longer
have to worry about decoding your (byte) strings to Unicode arrays or
binding your Unicode code-points to the right (byte-) string
representations. While this might seem like something that should have
been done long ago, for historic reasons older programming languages
(plus Python pre-3.0) use ASCII as the default encoding, meaning you had
to look after de-/encoding the whole time when working with input/output
functionality of your programs and using most other languages other than
English - and even there you might want to have special characters
(don't be so naïve...). Sad side to this: what I am talking about here
is standard in Java...</p>
<p>However, you no longer need to worry with 3.0: First, the totally
useless old String object (str) has been removed (to be exact, it could
be said it is now &quot;integrated&quot; into the bytes and bytearray objects),
including the even more ridiculous &quot;encode&quot; method for old str objects:
bytes and bytearray only support a &quot;decode&quot; message (to the new Unicode
str objects), while the intended use of str.encode, transforming Byte
objects that were represented as str objects in pre-3.0, like zip or
base64, now has to be done through a new method called &quot;translate&quot; on
the new bytes and bytearray objects in 3.0, or via encode on the new str
object. This was a dangerous duck typing strategy to have str.encode in
pre-3.0: as Unicode objects can and should have this method, too, but as
you could not tell if you were calling encode on a Unicode object or a
String object (without something like writing:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
assert isinstance(my_obj, unicode)
</pre>
<p>before every call to encode, at least), you could have been decoding
Unicode and encoding Strings - and because Python was (yes, was (!) -
see below) as &quot;nice&quot; as to do auto-coercion for you, without very
thorough testing libraries such a bug could go unnoticed for a long time
in pre-3.0. So, my praise to whomever was responsible for that decision!</p>
<p>On the other hand, the unicode object is now the new str object, sans
the even more useless and dangerous &quot;decode&quot; functionality: the new
(Unicode) str object only supports str.encode (for cases where you want
something else than UTF-8), while str.decode is finally dropped from the
Python Standarad Library. Obviously, you might have a system that does
not want UTF-8, and encoding your Unicode str to whatever schema you
need with str.encode the whole time would be a pain; To define a
different encoding globally, Python uses your &quot;coding&quot; declaration in
the first lines of your program as the default encoding schema for all
your new, shiny Unicode str objects. I.e., writing:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
# -*- coding: funny-arab-dialect -*-
</pre>
<p>will be enough if you have some strange language sporting glyphs that
require characters not found in the Unicode consortium's codetables, or
you might want to set it back to ASCII (the default in pre-3.0) if you
really need to ensure nothing other than good, old &quot;7-bit&quot; is output by
your program. On a side note: UTF-8 is compatible with ASCII, while
UTF-16 is not; i.e., an ASCII string encoded using the UTF-8 codetable
still gives the right characters, trying this with UTF-16 encoding does
not - and a good explanation why we have still not moved to UTF-16 in
general.</p>
<p>Finally, the really dangerous auto-coercion of Python between Strings,
Unicode representations, and Byte arrays is gone for good. Your
message's argument types must now match the receiving object's type and
comparisons between the different types always evaluate to false. This
last change might sound drastic if seen from a purely rapid prototyping
view, but everybody with some intent on not going crazy while
programming will greatly appreciate this change. The bugs and exploits
stemming from wrong (en/de-) coding, or, let's say, too much duck typing
the str and unicode objects in pre-3.0 Python (yeah, I love to put the
fault on somebody else...) are finally gone! Also, as all Strings are
now represented as Unicode str objects, you no longer need to worry if,
while comparing two str objects, they are using the same encoding -
which was another fountain of bugs in pre-3.0 Python - as any String is
internally managed as universal Unicode.</p>
<p>What is left to say? These changes are dramatic (even if they should
have been made already long ago with 2.0), and it will take a while
until Python 3.0 will have replaced 2.7 (the final, upcoming stable 2.x
release, which will warn you about code that will break with 3.0). But
the message should be clear: the effort of converting your libraries to
the next generation of Python is more than worth it, and the 2to3
converter should help if you had your encoding/decoding correct. If not,
converting to 3.0 might help you uncover some nasty bugs you were not
even aware of! Other reasons to &quot;convert&quot; would be:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>no more longs, which are now ints and unlimited in size (think of
what happend when reaching maxint before...),</li>
<li>generator/views from most operations formerly returning lists (think:
time used for creating and garbage collecting those temporary lists),</li>
<li>function annotations for metaclassing and advanced decorators,</li>
<li>nonlocal scope (similar to LISPs lexical scope),</li>
<li>dictionary comprehensions (&quot;{k: v for k, v in my_dict}&quot;) and set
literals (&quot;my_set = {1, 2}&quot;),</li>
<li>and tons of streamlining the syntax and Standard Library.</li>
</ul>
