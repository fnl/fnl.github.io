<p>Welcome, stranger! I am Florian &quot;fnl&quot; Leitner, an Austrian living in his exile of choice: Madrid, Spain. To give you a better idea of what you will find on this blog, here is a bit of a background about me.
Regarding my professional details, feel free to have a look at my <a class="reference external" href="http://fnl.es/pdfs/Florian_Leitner_CV.pdf">CV</a>.</p>
<p>Back in 2001, I moved to Vienna to study molecular biology, and in the same year began working on computational biology (with BioPerl back then): By the end of my first university year, I had managed to get into a practical at Novartis, and have kept going ever since.
If expressed in the terminology of the current &quot;Big Data&quot; hype, this makes me a data scientist for molecular biology - and indicates that bioinformaticans could very well represent one of the more &quot;ancient&quot; data scientist &quot;species&quot; around. (Only if statisticians count as the &quot;ancestors&quot; of data scientists, and physicists are doing too weird stuff to be factored in at all, naturally…)
My area of interest and PhD has been on text mining, obviously for molecular biology, and I have a healthy appetite for mathematical models that make machines &quot;think&quot; like humans, including artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>On a more political agenda, I believe the declaration of the human rights has been the biggest achievement of humanity so far (now we only need to observe them…)
I am a vivid defender of (personal) privacy and a supporter of all kinds of free software.
Going even further, we should get rid of copyright laws and the patent system:
Our modern copyright laws were <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_copyright_law">historically</a> created by the Roman Catholic Church together with English, French, and German monarchs.
During the Age of Enlightenment, copyright laws were explicitly designed to prohibit the spread of knowledge and censor information and effectively continue to do so to date.
Patents, on the other hand, <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Societal_views_on_patents.">arguably</a> only serve patent trolls and big-time corporations instead of protecting individuals (i.e., inventors).
These artificial monopolies on pharmaceuticals, software, and other technology that are created by the patent system are degrading livelihoods, innovation and societal evolution.
For example, patents on human genes are <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRCA1#Patents.2C_enforcement.2C_litigation.2C_and_controversy">limiting</a> our ability to prevent and cure cancer.</p>
<p>In terms of lifestyle, I love arts, traveling, nature, and Alpine sports and might once in a while write about some of the awe-inspiring places you can find on our planet.
Finally, and most dear to my heart, is my just recently started family, that is my wife Mayte and son Alexander.
Over time, you will hopefully find some content about all these topics on this blog.
