<p>Welcome, stranger! I am Florian &quot;fnl&quot; Leitner, an Austrian living in his exile of choice: Madrid, Spain. To give you a better idea of what you will find on this blog, here is a bit of a background about me.</p>
<p>I have dedicated myself to Molecular Biology, particularly Bioinformatics, in the past dozen or so years;
If interpreted in the context of the current Big Data hype, I therefore am a &quot;Data Scientist&quot; for Molecular Biology - which indicates that we Bioinformaticans could very well be one of the most ancient &quot;Data Scientists&quot; around…
My area of interest and PhD has been on Text Mining, obviously for Molecular Biology, and I have a healthy apetite for means that make machines &quot;think&quot; like humans, meaning Artificial Intelligence.</p>
<p>In general, I belive the declaration of the human rights to have been the biggest achievement of humanity so far (now we only need to actually follow them…)
Also, I am a vivid defender of personal privacy and supporter of open source, while we urgently need to get rid of copyright laws and the patent system to not hamper our societal evolution.
In terms of lifestyle, I love arts, travelling, nature, and Alpine sports.
Finally, and most dear to my heart, is my just recently started family, that is my wife Mayte and son Alexander.</p>
<p>Over time, you will hopefully find some content about all these topics on this blog.</p>
<p>Out of my strong opinions about privacy, I avoid the total exposure of my private life to governmental organizations and trans-national cooperations that you (maybe unconciously) subdue yourself by owning a &quot;smart&quot; phone and storing your whole life's data in the Cloud.
And no, I am not being paranoid: There is hard evidence for the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zeit.de/digital/datenschutz/2011-03/data-protection-malte-spitz/seite-1">tracking</a> <em>and</em> the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/prism">sniffing</a> going on - <a class="reference external" href="http://www.onread.com/book/Brave-New-World-191056/">Huxley</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.george-orwell.org/1984">Orwell</a> didn't even scratch the surface of what was to come…
So don't waste your time trying to &quot;Whats-App&quot; me or convince me to contribute content to &quot;people monitoring&quot; (social network) sites.
On top of all that, it frightens me to see - in restaurants and bars, at dinner tables at home, or in any other place people normally would talk to each other - more and more people turn into &quot;Matrix dummys&quot; that rather stare at their gadget than actually interact with each other.</p>
