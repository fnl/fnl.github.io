                    </h2>
                    
                    <p>In the last few weeks I had been to Cadiz and Almeria, both in
the south of Spain. Well, actually I was in none of those cities, but in
places close by.</p>
<p>The first trip together with Gema was down to Cadiz, about 30 km south
of the city some of Gemas friends were renting a flat in <a class="reference external" href="http://maps.google.es/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Conil,+Spain&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=11&amp;om=1">Conil</a>, a
village nearby. South of Cadiz you basically find the probably most
beautiful beaches of Spain, at least that was my impression and what my
Spanish friends told me (and, on a side note, the most incredible amount
of beautiful girls, too...). The only downside is that it can be kind of
windy, but if you know it, just bring some very stable wind protection,
and you should be fine. Actually, the one day it was windy, I was quite
happy, because with the burning sun having a swim and then cooling in
the breeze is a real relief. We also visited Tarifa, one of the main
wind- and kite surfing sites of Europe. You never saw a village so small
just full of surf shops - if you ask me, more dense than the skiing
shops in the tourist-trap villages in Tirol. Also we spent some time in
Los Caños de Meca, right between Conil and Tarifa, which is a real hippy
town and has a cool bar which is made up a bit like a ship deck and is
above a cliff looking out over the Atlantic. Great place to have some
&quot;copas&quot; (drinks)! On our way back to Madrid we took the time to stop in
Cordoba, which might be, together with Sevilla, the hottest (in
temperature, man!) town of Spain. In the center you can visit an
enormous (like in really enormous) mosque, as Cordoba and Granade where
interchangeably the capitals of the Arabian empire during the medieval
ages. Now it houses several (!!!) churches inside and it is really worth
paying the 8 Euros entry. Gema was slightly angry about my cultural
blasphemy, as the first thing that came to my mind upon entering was
&quot;and where is Indiana Jones?&quot;...</p>
<p>The second trip to Almeria in the southeast corner of Spain was
actually for a festival, the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.creamfields-andalucia.com/">Creamfields</a> in Spain. This festival is
exclusively for electronic music, and the lineup were bands and DJs like
Basement Jaxx, The Prodigy, or John Digweed. It's a 14 h festival
&quot;only&quot;, starting at 6 pm and lasting until about 8 am the next morning.
But believe me, that was by far enough for me, and it took me several
days to recover... The greatest thing about this location is that you
have the After Hour right smack on the beach, hanging out in the sun and
taking an occasional bath to cool down. Although it was great, I am not
sure to recommend it again: This year they had 50k visitors, and the
only access is a single little road, which meant we were jamming 2 1/2 h
in the car just to get in, and then another 1/2 h walk from the parking
place to the actual festival. Considering that they have more attendees
every year, I don't want to know how bad it will be next year. So if you
feel like going, I might recommend you come a day earlier and put up
tent there on the beach (actually, better in the wood at the side of the
beach - if you can't imagine why, just do as I recommend...).</p>
<p>So, all in all, two really gorgeous trips around Spain, and I am
looking forward to some more in the days to come this year. The only
thing I could slap my ass for is that I on both occasions forgot to
bring my camera...</p>

                    </h2>
                    
                    <p>Just now again, I stumbled across one of these mind-numbing blog posts
telling you what makes a &quot;good&quot; - sometimes even &quot;great&quot; - programmer.
As always, it went on about programming before college, having
programmed in private, knowing all sorts of technologies, being witty
and intelligent, etc. etc. etc.. Google it, you'll find dozens of such
articles. On those standards I would be a great programmer, as I usually
fit almost any point on such ridiculous lists, just as most of us
programmers do to a certain extent, and for sure after some time in the
programming biz. First of, I do NOT consider myself a &quot;great
programmer.&quot; Why? Because I have actually worked alongside truly great
programmers. Also, I have worked with many a programmer, yet I still do
not even need all fingers of one hand to count up all &quot;great ones.&quot; So
what makes up a great programmer? Actually, you can sum it up to three
quintessential points, in increasing degree of difficulty: A good
programmer...</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>...knows his interface.</li>
<li>...can communicate his work to anyone.</li>
<li>...surpasses the time and space constraints of a project.</li>
</ol>
<p>To make this a bit more clear: (1) pertains to all HCI
(human-computer-interface) related stuff like OS, IDE, or keyboard (!);
but also libraries, tools, and the knowledge of at least one programming
language close to the skill level of writing the API for it. There is no
need for somebody knowing several languages, if he can't handle at least
one really well. (2) Is about his ability to discuss the needs,
problems, requirements, etc. with his boss, a client, or a fellow mate
at just the right level of technical detail and conciseness necessary.
The third point finally is the most important of all, and usually never
even gets mentioned in most of these page-filling &quot;what makes a good
programmer&quot;-lists, much to my amusement (and is the main reason why I
just had to blog this...). This point implies, a great programmer is
capable of telling you how long his job will take (or at least will
conclude that he cannot make - for good reasons - a true estimate and
will know how to &quot;bet on the safe side&quot;), and he will then finish that
job by that estimate. Also, the way he has designed and implemented the
program will be such that others can follow as long as they have the
technical background (&quot;best practices&quot;, etc.), and will have all
interfaces and crucial nodes developed in a style which requires minimal
and necessary (i.e., optimal) documentation. Of these space and time
constraints (deadline, design, implementation, and documentation) all
will be fulfilled, and at least one of them will surpass what one was
expecting when the project started. I'd say it is usually the toughest
aspect making up great programmers.</p>
<p>I know that almost all guys saying they're &quot;good programmers&quot; (just
because they're too many) fail at least two of these three requirements,
and I freely admit I have my weaknesses in some of them and therefore do
not consider myself in the top league (hey, I'm working on it ;)); but
at least I realize those are the guys pulling of the great stunts; not
the ones who started programming at age ten, do it sixteen hours a day,
and know &quot;all&quot; about twenty different IT technologies (believe me, you
just can't...). We all are somewhat like this at certain points in time,
but the great ones got the above three points right, and especially
those three; That's what makes them uniquely different. So, please stop
glorifying your enthusiasm with stupid post on what makes &quot;great&quot;
programmers, but really only showing what nerds you are. Thank you!</p>

                    <p>As everyone has one, I just thought I might as well also put together
my personal list of the most useful applications for your nifty Mac
running the one and only truly user-friendly, working windowed OS: X!
The lists are ordered by importance, some apps are non-free, but I
explain why I use them and why you might want to as well.</p>
<div class="section" id="system-tools">
<h2>System Tools</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/">Quicksilver</a> - application launcher, action and command window -
THE most important app to have on any Mac, just get it (and learn to
use it...).</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://free.abracode.com/cmworkshop/">OnMyCommand</a> - custom right click context menus. Great tool, I use
it for a tons of stuff from SVN repository interaction, file settings
and archiving, to things like &quot;select a Madrid address to
automatically open the location in Google maps&quot; or &quot;translate the
selected text to English/Spanish.&quot;</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://cyberduck.ch/">Cyberduck</a> - is a great FTP/SFTP client, if you need one - and
definitely more elegant than using Finder...</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="editors">
<h2>Editors</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://aquamacs.org/">Aquamacs</a> - is the one-in-all solution and my favorite emacs port
for the Mac. Although, I only use it for LisP and C programming now,
as I have TextMate (see below) for my Python and web development as
well as simple text editing.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.uoregon.edu/%7Ekoch/texshop/">TexShop</a> - is the most comfortable WYSINWYG (what you see is NOT
what you get...) editor for LaTeX, which is the most reliable and
stable environment to write books and papers. Yet, you naturally just
can keep editing your TeX in emacs/Aquamacs...</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.macromates.com/">TextMate</a> - editor is kinda cool in some senses, but has some
drawbacks: first, it ain't free - I have it because my research
institute bought a license for me without even asking. It doesn't
know LisP and C. Most features it has you can have with emacs or (if
things would come to worst) write them with ELisP for emacs instead
of learning the TM macro commands. Yet, some things are kinda cool,
especially the filebrowser and codebrowser I prefer over the emacs
Speedbar. It is great for Python, Ruby, XML, Perl, JavaScript and SVN
interaction (if you are damned to program Java, use Eclipse...). So
that, incredibly fast startup, and decent column selection (you can
have that in emacs with a plug, too!) are my reasons for using it. If
you are willing to spend the bucks, get it. If you want an all-in-one
solution stick with some emacs.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="getting-things-done">
<h2>Getting Things Done</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.barebones.com/products/yojimbo/">Yojimbo</a> - if you are only willing to spend money on just one
single application, this is it. This is sort of a multi-functional
archiver: it stores your serial numbers, passwords, credit card
details, invoices, interesting documents, webpages and pdfs, the
metro plan of your city - whatever, you name it. Stuff is properly
encrypted using AES for protection. You can sort, tag, file your
content in a very decent way and you actually get to immediately find
the information again. This thing should be standard in any OS X
distribution, makes life so much simpler.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://journler.com/">Journler</a> - is a nice diary to keep track of what you are doing and
your ideas about it. I use it as my development diary (&quot;lab journal&quot;
would be the term, I guess...). You can add all sorts of media to
your entries (videos, sound (voice recordings!), images) and even
upload your entries to your blog. Cool!</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://bargiel.home.pl/iGTD/">iGTD</a> - yet another GettingThingsDone client - if you are in a
situation like me and have 10k things in your head and another 10k
todos, this is what helps you keeping track of what's next.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.apple.com/iwork/keynote/">Keynote</a> - from the iWork package; if you need to do presentations:
please do not try to infest your gorgeous Mac with crap software from
Redmond. Do your presentations with Keynote - their just better,
nicer and more aesthetic.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="media">
<h2>Media</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/">VideoLANClient (VLC)</a> - the media player for the Mac: no more
problems with missing audio/video codes, plays (almost) everything
and allows full screen for free (a two thumbs down on QuickTime for
this one!).</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.getdemocracy.com/">Democracy</a> - player, the most fun way to handle, download and
archive your video collection from YouTube, Yahoo! and Google Video,
Blogdigger, et al. as well as any clips, vids and movies you have
locally. Supports full screen viewing for free (as opposed to
QuickTime...), but ain't as versatile with codecs as VLC - but you
can teach Democracy to launch those vids in VLC.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/download/">iTunes</a> - is a must have if you own an iPod (or, eventually, an
iPhone...). If not, it is still the coolest way to keep track of your
podcasts, radio stations and browse your local MP3s (covers).</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/iphoto/">iPhoto</a> - should come with your Mac anyway AFAIK. The most
practical way of staying on top of your ever-growing picture and
image collection while integrating nicely with other apps (like
Keynote, Journler and many others).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="safari-plugins">
<h2>Safari Plugins</h2>
<p>If you are just such a Cocoa-fan as me, and prefer browsing with
Safari over Firefox (yes, OK, decent web development can only be done
with the fox, so you do need it anyway in this case...) here are some
plugs. There are some reasons to use Safari: integrates websites from
your Address Book into your Bookmarks, your bookmarks are system-wide
searchable, you can aggregate feeds very nicely, pushing URLs (weblocs)
to other apps is easy are just some. UPDATE: now back to the Fox again,
the plugins for it just rule! UPDATE (2008): and to Safari - high-speed,
nicest rendering of all browsers and WebKit rule even more!</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.kottke.org/05/02/saft-safari-plugin">Saft</a> - is the only plugin I can recommend to buy. And if only for
the full screen mode. This is just so much cooler than even the
crappy IExploder 7 full screen mode, as it actually intelligently
hides what you do not want to see currently (status bar, booksmarks,
URL bar). Naturally, it has tons of other features, too - check it
out.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.inquisitorx.com/safari/">Inquisitor</a> - is the coolest enhancement for the (Google) search
box and possibly the best free plugin. Just get it.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://pimpmysafari.com/plugins/safariblock-112">SafariBlock</a> - is a good way to block images, popups and frames you
don't wanna see. Not as powerful as Pith or Saft, but a free
alternative.</li>
</ul>
