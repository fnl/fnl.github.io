the jungle in the Amazons. I would have not thought I could repeat such
an experience that soon again, but was proven wrong shortly after. A few
weeks ago, my girlfriend spent some weeks in Spain and we used the last
long weekend we had together to go to Tenerife, Canary islands. There I
had the pleasure to visit yet another really strange and amazing place
in our world: a volcano! My girlfriend, who grew up in Mexico, thought
it was quite funny I had not seen a volcano before... Well, she has not
been on a glacier so far :-P. I can only recommend this place - if you
do not know where to go for a short trip for a few days, you just have
found it. We rented a very romantic small house on the north-eastern tip
of the island, far away from all the tourist places. The owner renting
it to us (Juan Ramón) is a very kind and friendly guy, and he even went
into the trouble to send me my keys and a whole load of money I forgot
in the house - without even taking a cent for the troubles, although I
kept insisting! (Anybody knowing me don't laugh! Okay, I know, typically
Flo...) The house itself is built into the cliffs, with a marvelous view
over the sea and the beach below, and a great terrace. Mayte, my
girlfriend, found it and I can only say this was a great choice. If you
feel like renting it, follow this &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.casas-turismo-rural.com/alojamiento.phtml?alojamiento=2740"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent five days there, which is just enough time to visit the island
in a hurry - time flew by like nothing. You have to ask permission to
access the volcano in the capital city, Santa Cruz, which will then be
granted to you for a following day at a certain hour. Naturally, we
managed to be there too late the next day, but arrived again the day
after and the friendly guys guarding the entrance let us up anyways. Oh,
and pleeease dress appropriately: you can't imagine the scores of
(Russian) girls trying to walk a volcano in high heels and with almost
nothing on - freezing to death at 3.700 m ASL and not able to walk in the
rocky area... Well, at least this allowed us to be completely alone at the
top of the crater! Another great feat of the park is, as it's at 2000+ m
ASL, that even if it's cloudy down on the beach, it might be a gorgeous
day in the park!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, one last word of warning: do not take residence on the south
side of the island except if you like artificial touristic sprawls: the
whole area is one urban block of concrete and completely hideous. As far
as I can tell, the north-east tip is best, maybe the (north-)western
areas may have some nice hideaways from the touristic towns, too. As for
the climate: just expect 20-25 ˚C in winter, 20-30 ˚C in summer - great!
One final recommendation if you like driving on narrow, curvy mountain
roads: rent a powerful car - I haven't had so much fun riding a car in a
long time!&lt;/p&gt;

If you know a tiny bit of its history with all the bloody civil wars
which have been almost continuously tormenting the country since the
40s, it is more than astonishing to find that the people themselves are
very open and friendly. The lush green on the countryside and the
amazing beaches on the coasts, mixed with some really high mountain
peaks allow for a variety you will not find in many other countries.
Finally, as it is next to the equator, the climate is almost all year
round the same: warm and mostly sunny (well, Bogotá is at 2,600 ASL, so
bring a warm jacket for the capital...).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current president, Uribe, is sending military forces everywhere in
the country to protect the civilians and tourists from attacks from
guerilla and paramilitary groups. Although you might not agree that this
is the best solution to the problem, you have to admit that he so far is
probably the most successful president in terms of restoring relative
security - at the great price of sacrificing the peoples personal
freedom, obviously; Colombia probably never has been as safe in the past
few decades as it is now - and it has by far less hostage-takings per
year as most uninformed people would make you believe (by now, something
below 600 per year). In my travels, I never felt more unsafe than in any
place in Europe - at least if you learn to ignore that at every second
corner you see a small group of military personnel or police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both major cities I visited, Bogotá and Cartagena, are really nice
cities - although the crazy traffic and taxi drivers in Bogotá can make
you feel a little ill to you stomach... Especially Cartagena is really
worth the visit, the old town being built in a style slightly similar to
the houses in Extremadura (Spain) - and not without reason probably,
as most Conquistadores came from this region of Spain. Yet, the bright
colors and plenty of flowers and green give the town a very unique and
lovely look. Last but not least, Cartagena is on the Caribbean coast and
therefore you have plenty of wonderful beaches to choose to spend your
day. On a general advice: usually, you take boats to get to those
beaches, which leave from the town center. Insist, really, to be taken
there by a tiny private boat (not more than 20 or so passengers) and do
not take one of the big ships: it cuts your beach stay in half, you are
dumped at a super-touristic aquarium nobody seemed interested in anyway,
and spend the boat time with hundreds of Colombian families (including
everything from grandmother to great-grand child). Not that it was my
worst experience ever, but there are more fun ways to waste your time...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major part of our travels - with my [now (*kiss*)] girlfriend
Mayte and two of her friends from Portugal and Spain, Xana and Ivan - we
spent in the Amazons. It is hard to describe the experience of visiting
the jungle, but if you have been to a real desert, on top of high
mountains or glaciers, or other really strange places, you know what I
am talking about. The biodiversity is so amazing you will never be able
to go back to a zoo or botanic garden without a knowing smile on your
face. I have no idea how many different plants I saw - including the
Victoria amazonica, the largest lotus in the world - but when one of our
guides was telling us about which plant heals what while in the jungle,
I got the impression of walking though a pharmacy... The animal life is
just as amazing: alligators, snakes, birds in all varieties and kinds,
spiders, sloths, insects of all sizes, piranhas (we even caught our own
- but as far as I can tell, it took us more chicken meat to catch them
than they yielded...), even dolphins (which get a pink tint when they
hunt because of their circulation - a really unique view) - plus another
few dozen or so I have missed to list here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving around the jungle might seem tough and dangerous at first - and
I make a bet it is, if you try to move cross-country straight through
the jungle for days. We were not intending to do that - we were moving
along the Amazonas river only - and always had at least a hut to sleep
in, with beds and mosquito nets in the most &amp;quot;extreme&amp;quot; cases. Most of the
time we spent in villages and towns (Leticia -&amp;gt; Puerto Nariño [a little
jewel in the Colombian Amazons and a must visit] -&amp;gt; Leticia/Tabatinga -&amp;gt;
and Manaus) in hotels, where you do not even need to use mosquito nets.
The greatest danger is you doing something stupid on your own. The
interested might want an advice on what to bring, so I'd suggest to
pack:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lots of insect repellent (we used Relec extra fuerte, about 1 bottle
[100 mL each] per person and week),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a light rain protection (if it rains really heavy - which it does
more or less every morning - just forget protection... this is more
against the wind and on boats),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some long-sleeves and long pants (protection against sun and/or while
hiking in the jungle),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;decent (!) hiking shoes,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;very strong sun protection (factor 40 or more - I used 60!),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a towel (no, this is no Hitchhikers Guide joke :-) - preferentially,
one of those micro-towels to save space and weight),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a flashlight,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a small first aid kit with antibiotics against diarrhea, pills to
dampen fever and Malaria effects (Ibuprofen 600, Malaron - just in
case - I strongly advise against taking those Malaria pills on the
trip as prevention if you do not go jungle-trekking for many days!
The side effects are rather ugly, and actually the pills only reduce
the effects of Malaria, they do not really help prevent it.),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suero (salt &amp;amp; electrolytes) powder, and a lots of it! This protects you
from dehydrating and diarrhea; My friends all laughed at me for
drinking a liter of it a day (it tastes rather ugly), but I was the
only of our group to not have to spend a day on the pot in the end...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a very light (I used silk) sleeping bag, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;something to pass time (books, card games, etc. - hey, it's Colombia,
no need to be in a hurry).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a final shout-out: many thanks to my amazing travel companions (aka
&amp;quot;los pendejos/tottos&amp;quot;...) and some very special ones to the most
gorgeous girl in the world that I am more than just happy to have become
close with during this trip: You provided me with one of the most
exciting trips I ever have made in my life!&lt;/p&gt;

the south of Spain. Well, actually I was in none of those cities, but in
places close by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first trip was down to Cadiz, about 30 km south
of the city some of our friends were renting a flat in &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://maps.google.es/maps?f=q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;q=Conil,+Spain&amp;amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;z=11&amp;amp;om=1"&gt;Conil&lt;/a&gt;, a
village nearby. South of Cadiz you basically find the probably most
beautiful beaches of Spain, at least that was my impression and what my
Spanish friends told me (and, on a side note, the most incredible amount
of beautiful girls, too...). The only downside is that it can be kind of
windy, but if you know it, just bring some very stable wind protection,
and you should be fine. Actually, the one day it was windy, I was quite
happy, because with the burning sun having a swim and then cooling in
the breeze is a real relief. We also visited Tarifa, one of the main
wind- and kite surfing sites of Europe. You never saw a village so small
just full of surf shops - if you ask me, more dense than the skiing
shops in the tourist-trap villages in Tirol. Also we spent some time in
Los Caños de Meca, right between Conil and Tarifa, which is a real hippy
town and has a cool bar which is made up a bit like a ship deck and is
above a cliff looking out over the Atlantic. Great place to have some
&amp;quot;copas&amp;quot; (drinks)! On our way back to Madrid we took the time to stop in
Cordoba, which might be, together with Sevilla, the hottest (in
temperature, man!) town of Spain. In the center you can visit an
enormous (like in really enormous) mosque, as Cordoba and Granade where
interchangeably the capitals of the Arabian empire during the medieval
ages. Now it houses several (!!!) churches inside and it is really worth
paying the 8 Euros entry. My GF was slightly angry about my cultural
blasphemy, as the first thing that came to my mind upon entering was
&amp;quot;and where is Indiana Jones?&amp;quot;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second trip to Almeria in the southeast corner of Spain was
actually for a festival, the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.creamfields-andalucia.com/"&gt;Creamfields&lt;/a&gt; in Spain. This festival is
exclusively for electronic music, and the lineup were bands and DJs like
Basement Jaxx, The Prodigy, or John Digweed. It's a 14 h festival
&amp;quot;only&amp;quot;, starting at 6 pm and lasting until about 8 am the next morning.
But believe me, that was by far enough for me, and it took me several
days to recover... The greatest thing about this location is that you
have the After Hour right smack on the beach, hanging out in the sun and
taking an occasional bath to cool down. Although it was great, I am not
sure to recommend it again: This year they had 50k visitors, and the
only access is a single little road, which meant we were jamming 2 1/2 h
in the car just to get in, and then another 1/2 h walk from the parking
place to the actual festival. Considering that they have more attendees
every year, I don't want to know how bad it will be next year. So if you
feel like going, I might recommend you come a day earlier and put up
tent there on the beach (actually, better in the wood at the side of the
beach - if you can't imagine why, just do as I recommend...).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, all in all, two really gorgeous trips around Spain, and I am
looking forward to some more in the days to come this year. The only
thing I could slap my ass for is that I on both occasions forgot to
bring my camera...&lt;/p&gt;

skiing here. There are the Pyrenees, where you could expect some areas,
but I was not expecting anything anywhere else. Meanwhile, I have been
skiing in Asturias (north, center) and Sierra Nevada (south, with a view
of Africa!)... Especially the latter was quite convincing: a large skiing
area with a lot of people who can actually ski (for Tyrolean standards
quite hard to achieve!). Just thought it would be kind of crazy to be
skiing end of March in Spain, while having a glimpse at Africa and
enjoying almost 20 ˚C in the &amp;quot;valley&amp;quot; (that is, Granada).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I am at it: Granada is quite a beautiful town, and naturally there
is the Alhambra to visit (but I did not enter: you have to reserve at
least 2 months ahead if you want to get in...). There are more foreigners
here than in Madrid, naturally, and it seems to have slightly less extreme
temperatures than the capital. Nice place to live, I guess: 1 hour for
skiing, 1 hour to the beach!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, there are 3 decent areas for skiing in Spain: the Pyrenees,
Asturias and Granada/Sierra Nevada. I have not seen the first, but
everybody tells me it is the best place (Update: I've been there, in
Formigal - yes, it is nice there). Anyway, I'd say Granada is
definitely the fanciest and worth a visit, too. And then you can ski on
about any other mountain range here, too (e.g., Gredos, Guadarrama, etc.),
but for my taste, the slopes there are not quite as steep and long as I'd
like them.&lt;/p&gt;
