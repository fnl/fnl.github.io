                    <p>The recent reports on renditions of terrorism suspects have reached an
alarming rate. Compare what happened during the middle ages and what is
occurring now again with slightly different circumstances:</p>
<p>If you have one of these characteristics, you might be a
witch/<em>terrorist</em>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Red/<em>Dark</em> hair,</li>
<li>green/<em>dark</em> eyes,</li>
<li>female/<em>non-caucasian</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are considered a “target” by these traits, you can be
“rightfully” tortured by the inquisition/secret service.</p>
<p>Governments worldwide, including most likely yours, are actively
ignoring our most basic rights in the name of “safety”. More and more
people are disappearing into “black sites”, tortured and ill-treated for
years and years - at levels where even the inquisition was not as bad as
compared to what is happening here and now, today. On the other hand, we
Japanese, EU, and US citizens have fought for so many centuries to
arrive at a status where everybody should understand the necessity for
human rights, free speech, etc.. It took two world wars and millions of
deaths to realize these trivial facts. Now governments are openly taking
away your rights from you again, trying to tell you they are
“protecting” you from a threat that virtually does not exist. And even
if it would exist, it does not give anybody the right to destroy the
life of any living person at their very foundations. If you do not act
now, you are either yourself approving that anybody, including you, may
be tortured for the sake of “security”, or are ignorant enough to
believe this will simply “go away” again some day.</p>
<p>Please, do not let this continue; do not let humanity fall back into a
state that could be even worse than the middle ages. Any day you spend
not protesting against these inhuman and useless acts of random force
against humanity you are indirectly killing and torturing, too. Any day
this continues, your rights will deteriorate.</p>
<p>If you do not protest or voice your opinion, you are indirectly
granting the governments of this world with the right to kill and
torture people at will. If you do not raise your voice, you, too, are
part of this machinery, killing and torturing because your silence is
set equal to agreeing to your government's actions in a democratic
world. Act now, and raise your voice against this madness - while we
still have the right of freedom of speech (or do we?).</p>
<p>POST-EDIT: On an interesting side note, the only <a class="reference external" href="http://www.petitiononline.com/stoper/petition.html">petition where anybody
worldwide can sign</a>, has exactly 139 signees at the time of this
writing. How sad…</p>
<p>POST-POST-EDIT: At least, there is an Amnesty International page against
Guantanamo Bay and illegal US torture <a class="reference external" href="http://www.tearitdown.org/">here</a>, which almost 140,000
people have signed so far - even though I think it should be dozens of
millions if humans were capable of using their head…</p>
<p>POST-3-EDIT: And another very good video from AI published yesterday on
the subject: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/video-and-audio/no-justification-for-torture-20080626">Torture can never be justified</a>.</p>

                        <a href="http://www.fnl.es/amazonas-101.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to &quot;Amazonas 101&quot;">Amazonas 101</a>

                    <p>Colombia is one of the most magnificent countries I have been so far.
If you know a tiny bit of its history with all the bloody civil wars
which have been almost continuously tormenting the country since the
40s, it is more than astonishing to find that the people themselves are
very open and friendly. The lush green on the countryside and the
amazing beaches on the coasts, mixed with some really high mountain
peaks allow for a variety you will not find in many other countries.
Finally, as it is next to the equator, the climate is almost all year
round the same: warm and mostly sunny (well, Bogotá is at 2,600 ASL, so
bring a warm jacket for the capital...).</p>
<p>The current president, Uribe, is sending military forces everywhere in
the country to protect the civilians and tourists from attacks from
guerilla and paramilitary groups. Although you might not agree that this
is the best solution to the problem, you have to admit that he so far is
probably the most successful president in terms of restoring relative
security - at the great price of sacrificing the peoples personal
freedom, obviously; Colombia probably never has been as safe in the past
few decades as it is now - and it has by far less hostage-takings per
year as most uninformed people would make you believe (by now, something
below 600 per year). In my travels, I never felt more unsafe than in any
place in Europe - at least if you learn to ignore that at every second
corner you see a small group of military personnel or police.</p>
<p>Both major cities I visited, Bogotá and Cartagena, are really nice
cities - although the crazy traffic and taxi drivers in Bogotá can make
you feel a little ill to you stomach... Especially Cartagena is really
worth the visit, the old town being built in a style slightly similar to
the houses in Extremadura (Spain) - and not without reason probably,
as most Conquistadores came from this region of Spain. Yet, the bright
colors and plenty of flowers and green give the town a very unique and
lovely look. Last but not least, Cartagena is on the Caribbean coast and
therefore you have plenty of wonderful beaches to choose to spend your
day. On a general advice: usually, you take boats to get to those
beaches, which leave from the town center. Insist, really, to be taken
there by a tiny private boat (not more than 20 or so passengers) and do
not take one of the big ships: it cuts your beach stay in half, you are
dumped at a super-touristic aquarium nobody seemed interested in anyway,
and spend the boat time with hundreds of Colombian families (including
everything from grandmother to great-grand child). Not that it was my
worst experience ever, but there are more fun ways to waste your time...</p>
<p>The major part of our travels - with my [now (*kiss*)] girlfriend
Mayte and two of her friends from Portugal and Spain, Xana and Ivan - we
spent in the Amazons. It is hard to describe the experience of visiting
the jungle, but if you have been to a real desert, on top of high
mountains or glaciers, or other really strange places, you know what I
am talking about. The biodiversity is so amazing you will never be able
to go back to a zoo or botanic garden without a knowing smile on your
face. I have no idea how many different plants I saw - including the
Victoria amazonica, the largest lotus in the world - but when one of our
guides was telling us about which plant heals what while in the jungle,
I got the impression of walking though a pharmacy... The animal life is
just as amazing: alligators, snakes, birds in all varieties and kinds,
spiders, sloths, insects of all sizes, piranhas (we even caught our own
- but as far as I can tell, it took us more chicken meat to catch them
than they yielded...), even dolphins (which get a pink tint when they
hunt because of their circulation - a really unique view) - plus another
few dozen or so I have missed to list here.</p>
<p>Moving around the jungle might seem tough and dangerous at first - and
I make a bet it is, if you try to move cross-country straight through
the jungle for days. We were not intending to do that - we were moving
along the Amazonas river only - and always had at least a hut to sleep
in, with beds and mosquito nets in the most &quot;extreme&quot; cases. Most of the
time we spent in villages and towns (Leticia -&gt; Puerto Nariño [a little
jewel in the Colombian Amazons and a must visit] -&gt; Leticia/Tabatinga -&gt;
and Manaus) in hotels, where you do not even need to use mosquito nets.
The greatest danger is you doing something stupid on your own. The
interested might want an advice on what to bring, so I'd suggest to
pack:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>lots of insect repellent (we used Relec extra fuerte, about 1 bottle
[100 mL each] per person and week),</li>
<li>a light rain protection (if it rains really heavy - which it does
more or less every morning - just forget protection... this is more
against the wind and on boats),</li>
<li>some long-sleeves and long pants (protection against sun and/or while
hiking in the jungle),</li>
<li>decent (!) hiking shoes,</li>
<li>very strong sun protection (factor 40 or more - I used 60!),</li>
<li>a towel (no, this is no Hitchhikers Guide joke :-) - preferentially,
one of those micro-towels to save space and weight),</li>
<li>a flashlight,</li>
<li>a small first aid kit with antibiotics against diarrhea, pills to
dampen fever and Malaria effects (Ibuprofen 600, Malaron - just in
case - I strongly advise against taking those Malaria pills on the
trip as prevention if you do not go jungle-trekking for many days!
The side effects are rather ugly, and actually the pills only reduce
the effects of Malaria, they do not really help prevent it.),</li>
<li>Suero (salt &amp; electrolytes) powder, and a lots of it! This protects you
from dehydrating and diarrhea; My friends all laughed at me for
drinking a liter of it a day (it tastes rather ugly), but I was the
only of our group to not have to spend a day on the pot in the end...</li>
<li>a very light (I used silk) sleeping bag, and</li>
<li>something to pass time (books, card games, etc. - hey, it's Colombia,
no need to be in a hurry).</li>
</ul>
<p>On a final shout-out: many thanks to my amazing travel companions (aka
&quot;los pendejos/tottos&quot;...) and some very special ones to the most
gorgeous girl in the world that I am more than just happy to have become
close with during this trip: You provided me with one of the most
exciting trips I ever have made in my life!</p>

                    <p>If you don't know what <a class="reference external" href="http://www.unep.org/geo/geo4">GEO-4</a> (4th Global Environment Outlook) is, it is
about high time to get you informed. This is a recent publication by the
United Nations, explaining why this planet's ecosystem and the human
race is close to the point of no return, facing (unavoidable)
extinction. Let's hope this is what the authors (390 scientist backed by
another 1000 reviewers) intend it to be: the final &quot;wake up call&quot; for
<strong>all</strong> of us.</p>
<p>To provide you a few facts:</p>
<p>We are currently, on a total, using 30 % more resources than earth can
provide for us; water contamination is the number 1 cause of death
worldwide; we are overfishing at a rate of 250 %; major regions of the
world's oceans having become oxygen dead zones (i.e. lifeless); in
Africa, food production over the past 20 years has declined by more than
10 %; somewhere between today and 2100 we will have reached a global
warming level which will lead to inevitable (&quot;point of no return&quot;)
extinction of the ecosystem (i.e. incl. humanity) - oh well, I could go
on... this report is approx. 400 pages! The only positive news I could
mine: at least the ozone layer will be recovering - although currently,
the Antarctic hole is still growing, being larger today than ever
before. The real message behind all this:
<strong>We have to act *now*!</strong></p>
<p>One last warning: this might be the most depressing news you ever
encountered, yet also the most important if you were not aware of these
facts (I surely wasnt aware of that many....)</p>
