                    </h2>
                    
                    <p>Obviously, from the huge gap between this and my last post you probably
already have imagined, mine was quite busy. To sum it up: I went to
Canada, then Mayte - that is my gorgeous girlfriend in case you still
don’t know! - was in Madrid for a whole month (happy me!!!) ad we went
to Tarragona, a city to the south of Barcelona, and to Bilbao. Finally,
I had to prepare for a talk in Turku, Finland, which was the last
“station” for me this summer.</p>
<p>First things first, I’ll start with the Canada trip. This was more or
less all payed by my institute because I went to the world’s largest
bioinformatics conference, the ISMB in Toronto, to present my
<a class="reference external" href="http://bcms.bioinfo.cnio.es">BioCreative MetaServer</a> project the first time. Reception was quite
good, and my boss and I were both quite happy. The hotel we stayed at,
although expensive, was rather crappy: The second day we got back, a
colleague of mine found another guy in his room, just taking a shower!
After some inquiries at the desk, they could not “determine” how the
mistake happend and the manager went up with my friend to clear the
matters up. The guy there the even refused to change the room! So my
friend finally decided to do the only logic thing and moved to another
room… Nice hotel, especially considering we were paying almost Can$ 200
a night! The city of Toronto itself is very US-like, with skyscrapers
and a downtown that gets all crappy and full of homeless people during
the night. I also was kind of annoyed by the way people act there -
everyone is just a bit too friendly for my taste, it seems more like a
show than for real. Finally, the city surely is cosy in winter: all the
center is connected with tunnels so you do never have to go outside -
brr, that makes me freeze just thinking of it! Another funny thing:
while we were there, the largest bike theft ever was going on; later the
police caught a bike seller stealing most of them - they found a whole
2,800 (!!!) bikes in his home, his shop, and in various garages he had
to rent to store all those bikes!</p>
<p>Mayte’s stay here without doubt was my personal highlight this summer,
and maybe even this year: she found a way to be here a whole month,
which we spent together almost every day (well, at least the nights…).
It will be a while before we can spend that much time together in a row
again! Anyways, apart from some good going out to “terrazas”, bars and
fancy night clubs here in Madrid, getting some even better dancing done
and listening to the latest electronic beats, we also did two trips to
the north of Spain and had a nice afternoon one weekend getting out of
the city sprawl and enjoying the great countryside - of which you can
ascertain yourself in the photos below. We went to Tarragona together
with Iris and Gonzalo to a Spa-Hotel with all sorts nice luxury like
Saunas, swimming pools, baths, massages, golf course, etc. and had a
very nice and relaxed weekend while celebrating Iris’ birthday. Actually
this is a really special occasion, as Iris usually loves to be with many
people and gives great parties with very many people (and nice Spanish
and Mexican girls … not that it would be any of my business nowadays!).
The second trip we made to Bilbao, enjoying the great landscape there,
making the obligatory - and worth while! - visit to the Guggenheim, as
well as having a heavy night out during the opening of the Semana
Grande, which had spectacular fireworks. While we were sitting in the
grass watching the fireworks, a group standing next to us with two guys
and a girl was watching just as delighted - when suddenly a really huge
explosion filled the whole sky above us in a startling view of little
stars falling down from the sky. The girl got rather frightened, jumped,
and ran a bit, when she finally just ducked “for cover” on the grass. I
admit it was not nice of us, but we had to laugh. Then her boyfriend
turned his head toward her and with a very nonchalant voice asked: “Que
tienes?” (“What’s up with you?” - “Was hast’n?”). The somewhat
frightened girlfriend returned to his side, while we keept giggling
every other time a huge rocket exploded and she started to make leeway…
Well, apart from that we had a great breakfast, too, with champagne and
caviar, of which I am sorry to say, I cannot give details. So, this city
is really worth a visit, especially if you have a person along who knows
her way around town, the bars, and the beaches. One day the time was
ripe for Mayte to go back, and I finally gave up my plans of taking here
hostage and let her go back - and now she is happy and far away from all
the bourgeois western world in South America… Man, do I miss her
company!</p>
<p>The third and final trip this summer was going to Turku. What, you
really do not know what or where Turku is? No worries, I didn’t either.
To be honest, it took me some time to find an acceptable travel route to
that place… But every Turku inhabitant will quickly assure you that you
missed out on history: it was, until about a hundred years ago, the
capital of Finland, and is also the oldest town to be found in that part
of the world. So, you might be asking yourself quite rightfully,
what-the-hell was I doing in such a remote location? Well, I was
attending a text-mining conference there: the SMBM’08 (Semantic Mining
in Biomedicine) and was giving an almost one hour long presentation
about my platform. So you can imagine it took my quite some time to
prepare the talk and the data to present, and, as I never had given a
talk of that length, quite some cups of tea (thanks to a tip from
Mayte!) before the talk to keep me calm. As a result, I had the feeling
the presentation was quite some success and the response from the
audience more than good. Anyhow, the “real” success will have to be
measured when seeing how many new participants I could attract to the
platform with this presentation - time will tell! Apart from work, we
had a great boat tour through the hundreds of tiny islands along the
coast, went to a Finish smoke Sauna with heated baths - you cool
yourself of by jumping into the (very cold) sea! - and a great dinner.
This had a rather funny ending, when the organizers fooled around with
me: there was a quiz about Finish wildlife, which I apparently won. They
gave me a bottle filled with transparent liquid and some finish text
explaining the contents. Without much thought I assumed it was vodka and
immediately got some shot glasses and shared the bottle with the
conference attendants. Much to our surprise, it did not have the taste
of vodka, but was a special kind of water extracted from birch trees… I
guess, I have to rethink my attitude about alcohol! As for the Finish
people themselves, there are some quite notable things: first of, it
really is true, they are blond, almost all of them! Second, and I really
was quite astonished, I never met that many friendly - and really
friendly, not that artificial stuff you find in the US and Canada -
people in any country before. The only thing why I think they are
slightly crazy occurred to me when, while walking through town at about
15 ˚C, with jackets and long pants, we passed by an outdoor, public
swimming pool: it was full of Fins “simulating” that it still was
summer!</p>
<p>Well, I am sure I forgot to cover some stuff, but then the post is
already long enough as it is. To all of you, have a nice autumn,
enjoying the last rays of sun - if you do not live in Spain!</p>

                    <p>The recent reports on renditions of terrorism suspects have reached an
alarming rate. Compare what happened during the middle ages and what is
occurring now again with slightly different circumstances:</p>
<p>If you have one of these characteristics, you might be a
witch/<em>terrorist</em>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Red/<em>Dark</em> hair,</li>
<li>green/<em>dark</em> eyes,</li>
<li>female/<em>non-caucasian</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are considered a “target” by these traits, you can be
“rightfully” tortured by the inquisition/secret service.</p>
<p>Governments worldwide, including most likely yours, are actively
ignoring our most basic rights in the name of “safety”. More and more
people are disappearing into “black sites”, tortured and ill-treated for
years and years - at levels where even the inquisition was not as bad as
compared to what is happening here and now, today. On the other hand, we
Japanese, EU, and US citizens have fought for so many centuries to
arrive at a status where everybody should understand the necessity for
human rights, free speech, etc.. It took two world wars and millions of
deaths to realize these trivial facts. Now governments are openly taking
away your rights from you again, trying to tell you they are
“protecting” you from a threat that virtually does not exist. And even
if it would exist, it does not give anybody the right to destroy the
life of any living person at their very foundations. If you do not act
now, you are either yourself approving that anybody, including you, may
be tortured for the sake of “security”, or are ignorant enough to
believe this will simply “go away” again some day.</p>
<p>Please, do not let this continue; do not let humanity fall back into a
state that could be even worse than the middle ages. Any day you spend
not protesting against these inhuman and useless acts of random force
against humanity you are indirectly killing and torturing, too. Any day
this continues, your rights will deteriorate.</p>
<p>If you do not protest or voice your opinion, you are indirectly
granting the governments of this world with the right to kill and
torture people at will. If you do not raise your voice, you, too, are
part of this machinery, killing and torturing because your silence is
set equal to agreeing to your government's actions in a democratic
world. Act now, and raise your voice against this madness - while we
still have the right of freedom of speech (or do we?).</p>
<p>POST-EDIT: On an interesting side note, the only <a class="reference external" href="http://www.petitiononline.com/stoper/petition.html">petition where anybody
worldwide can sign</a>, has exactly 139 signees at the time of this
writing. How sad…</p>
<p>POST-POST-EDIT: At least, there is an Amnesty International page against
Guantanamo Bay and illegal US torture <a class="reference external" href="http://www.tearitdown.org/">here</a>, which almost 140,000
people have signed so far - even though I think it should be dozens of
millions if humans were capable of using their head…</p>
<p>POST-3-EDIT: And another very good video from AI published yesterday on
the subject: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/video-and-audio/no-justification-for-torture-20080626">Torture can never be justified</a>.</p>

                    <h2 class="title">
                        <a href="http://fnl.es/amazonas-101.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to &quot;Amazonas 101&quot;">Amazonas 101</a>
                    </h2>
                    
                    <p>Colombia is one of the most magnificent countries I have been so far.
If you know a tiny bit of its history with all the bloody civil wars
which have been almost continuously tormenting the country since the
40s, it is more than astonishing to find that the people themselves are
very open and friendly. The lush green on the countryside and the
amazing beaches on the coasts, mixed with some really high mountain
peaks allow for a variety you will not find in many other countries.
Finally, as it is next to the equator, the climate is almost all year
round the same: warm and mostly sunny (well, Bogotá is at 2,600 ASL, so
bring a warm jacket for the capital...).</p>
<p>The current president, Uribe, is sending military forces everywhere in
the country to protect the civilians and tourists from attacks from
guerilla and paramilitary groups. Although you might not agree that this
is the best solution to the problem, you have to admit that he so far is
probably the most successful president in terms of restoring relative
security - at the great price of sacrificing the peoples personal
freedom, obviously; Colombia probably never has been as safe in the past
few decades as it is now - and it has by far less hostage-takings per
year as most uninformed people would make you believe (by now, something
below 600 per year). In my travels, I never felt more unsafe than in any
place in Europe - at least if you learn to ignore that at every second
corner you see a small group of military personnel or police.</p>
<p>Both major cities I visited, Bogotá and Cartagena, are really nice
cities - although the crazy traffic and taxi drivers in Bogotá can make
you feel a little ill to you stomach... Especially Cartagena is really
worth the visit, the old town being built in a style slightly similar to
the houses in Extremadura (Spain) - and not without reason probably,
as most Conquistadores came from this region of Spain. Yet, the bright
colors and plenty of flowers and green give the town a very unique and
lovely look. Last but not least, Cartagena is on the Caribbean coast and
therefore you have plenty of wonderful beaches to choose to spend your
day. On a general advice: usually, you take boats to get to those
beaches, which leave from the town center. Insist, really, to be taken
there by a tiny private boat (not more than 20 or so passengers) and do
not take one of the big ships: it cuts your beach stay in half, you are
dumped at a super-touristic aquarium nobody seemed interested in anyway,
and spend the boat time with hundreds of Colombian families (including
everything from grandmother to great-grand child). Not that it was my
worst experience ever, but there are more fun ways to waste your time...</p>
<p>The major part of our travels - with my [now (*kiss*)] girlfriend
Mayte and two of her friends from Portugal and Spain, Xana and Ivan - we
spent in the Amazons. It is hard to describe the experience of visiting
the jungle, but if you have been to a real desert, on top of high
mountains or glaciers, or other really strange places, you know what I
am talking about. The biodiversity is so amazing you will never be able
to go back to a zoo or botanic garden without a knowing smile on your
face. I have no idea how many different plants I saw - including the
Victoria amazonica, the largest lotus in the world - but when one of our
guides was telling us about which plant heals what while in the jungle,
I got the impression of walking though a pharmacy... The animal life is
just as amazing: alligators, snakes, birds in all varieties and kinds,
spiders, sloths, insects of all sizes, piranhas (we even caught our own
- but as far as I can tell, it took us more chicken meat to catch them
than they yielded...), even dolphins (which get a pink tint when they
hunt because of their circulation - a really unique view) - plus another
few dozen or so I have missed to list here.</p>
<p>Moving around the jungle might seem tough and dangerous at first - and
I make a bet it is, if you try to move cross-country straight through
the jungle for days. We were not intending to do that - we were moving
along the Amazonas river only - and always had at least a hut to sleep
in, with beds and mosquito nets in the most &quot;extreme&quot; cases. Most of the
time we spent in villages and towns (Leticia -&gt; Puerto Nariño [a little
jewel in the Colombian Amazons and a must visit] -&gt; Leticia/Tabatinga -&gt;
and Manaus) in hotels, where you do not even need to use mosquito nets.
The greatest danger is you doing something stupid on your own. The
interested might want an advice on what to bring, so I'd suggest to
pack:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>lots of insect repellent (we used Relec extra fuerte, about 1 bottle
[100 mL each] per person and week),</li>
<li>a light rain protection (if it rains really heavy - which it does
more or less every morning - just forget protection... this is more
against the wind and on boats),</li>
<li>some long-sleeves and long pants (protection against sun and/or while
hiking in the jungle),</li>
<li>decent (!) hiking shoes,</li>
<li>very strong sun protection (factor 40 or more - I used 60!),</li>
<li>a towel (no, this is no Hitchhikers Guide joke :-) - preferentially,
one of those micro-towels to save space and weight),</li>
<li>a flashlight,</li>
<li>a small first aid kit with antibiotics against diarrhea, pills to
dampen fever and Malaria effects (Ibuprofen 600, Malaron - just in
case - I strongly advise against taking those Malaria pills on the
trip as prevention if you do not go jungle-trekking for many days!
The side effects are rather ugly, and actually the pills only reduce
the effects of Malaria, they do not really help prevent it.),</li>
<li>Suero (salt &amp; electrolytes) powder, and a lots of it! This protects you
from dehydrating and diarrhea; My friends all laughed at me for
drinking a liter of it a day (it tastes rather ugly), but I was the
only of our group to not have to spend a day on the pot in the end...</li>
<li>a very light (I used silk) sleeping bag, and</li>
<li>something to pass time (books, card games, etc. - hey, it's Colombia,
no need to be in a hurry).</li>
</ul>
<p>On a final shout-out: many thanks to my amazing travel companions (aka
&quot;los pendejos/tottos&quot;...) and some very special ones to the most
gorgeous girl in the world that I am more than just happy to have become
close with during this trip: You provided me with one of the most
exciting trips I ever have made in my life!</p>
