                    </h2>
                    
                    <p>Just now again, I stumbled across one of these mind-numbing blog posts
telling you what makes a &quot;good&quot; - sometimes even &quot;great&quot; - programmer.
As always, it went on about programming before college, having
programmed in private, knowing all sorts of technologies, being witty
and intelligent, etc. etc. etc.. Google it, you'll find dozens of such
articles. On those standards I would be a great programmer, as I usually
fit almost any point on such ridiculous lists, just as most of us
programmers do to a certain extent, and for sure after some time in the
programming biz. First of, I do NOT consider myself a &quot;great
programmer.&quot; Why? Because I have actually worked alongside truly great
programmers. Also, I have worked with many a programmer, yet I still do
not even need all fingers of one hand to count up all &quot;great ones.&quot; So
what makes up a great programmer? Actually, you can sum it up to three
quintessential points, in increasing degree of difficulty: A good
programmer...</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>...knows his interface.</li>
<li>...can communicate his work to anyone.</li>
<li>...surpasses the time and space constraints of a project.</li>
</ol>
<p>To make this a bit more clear: (1) pertains to all HCI
(human-computer-interface) related stuff like OS, IDE, or keyboard (!);
but also libraries, tools, and the knowledge of at least one programming
language close to the skill level of writing the API for it. There is no
need for somebody knowing several languages, if he can't handle at least
one really well. (2) Is about his ability to discuss the needs,
problems, requirements, etc. with his boss, a client, or a fellow mate
at just the right level of technical detail and conciseness necessary.
The third point finally is the most important of all, and usually never
even gets mentioned in most of these page-filling &quot;what makes a good
programmer&quot;-lists, much to my amusement (and is the main reason why I
just had to blog this...). This point implies, a great programmer is
capable of telling you how long his job will take (or at least will
conclude that he cannot make - for good reasons - a true estimate and
will know how to &quot;bet on the safe side&quot;), and he will then finish that
job by that estimate. Also, the way he has designed and implemented the
program will be such that others can follow as long as they have the
technical background (&quot;best practices&quot;, etc.), and will have all
interfaces and crucial nodes developed in a style which requires minimal
and necessary (i.e., optimal) documentation. Of these space and time
constraints (deadline, design, implementation, and documentation) all
will be fulfilled, and at least one of them will surpass what one was
expecting when the project started. I'd say it is usually the toughest
aspect making up great programmers.</p>
<p>I know that almost all guys saying they're &quot;good programmers&quot; (just
because they're too many) fail at least two of these three requirements,
and I freely admit I have my weaknesses in some of them and therefore do
not consider myself in the top league (hey, I'm working on it ;)); but
at least I realize those are the guys pulling of the great stunts; not
the ones who started programming at age ten, do it sixteen hours a day,
and know &quot;all&quot; about twenty different IT technologies (believe me, you
just can't...). We all are somewhat like this at certain points in time,
but the great ones got the above three points right, and especially
those three; That's what makes them uniquely different. So, please stop
glorifying your enthusiasm with stupid post on what makes &quot;great&quot;
programmers, but really only showing what nerds you are. Thank you!</p>

                        <a href="http://fnl.es/installing-a-full-stack-python-data-analysis-environment-on-osx.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to &quot;Installing a full stack Python data analysis environment on OSX&quot;">Installing a full stack Python data analysis environment on OSX</a>
                    </h2>
                    
                    <p>It is a bit of an effort to install the latest <strong>numpy</strong> and <strong>scipy</strong>
libraries due to their dependencies on Fortran libraries, while Apple is
(was? ...) mostly neglecting all Fortran issues. Furthermore, when
trying to compile a collection of these libraries for Python 3k and 64
bit, all these headaches seem to magnify enough so that attempting to
use them with Py3k on OSX has to be very much discouraged by the author.
Getting NumPy to work on 64 bit with Py3k and playing nicely the various
&quot;high-level&quot; libraries and the R environment can become a nightmare on a
Mac. If you really need to use Py3k, but are married to OSX, you are
probably better off installing a virtual machine with your favorite
Linux distro than trying to get this ensemble to work natively. In other
words, OSX is not a good platform for scientific computing, and you are
living easier with what is available - unless you prefer spending your
time on tinkering over productivity. You have been warned…</p>
<p>This guide will outline how to install the following Python software
stack:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>NumPy (1.6.2)</li>
<li>SciPy (0.10.1)</li>
<li>MatPlotLib (1.2.0)</li>
<li>IPython (0.13.2)</li>
<li>Scikit-Learn (0.13)</li>
<li>RPy2 (2.3.2)</li>
</ul>
<p>Optional instructions to install the two &quot;new kids on the block&quot;,
Pandas and StatsModels, are provided, too. To get a 64 bit version of
all this software installed on OSX 10.6 through 10.8 that does work &quot;out
of the box&quot; (although admittedly not optimally due to the Fortran
issues!) without too much of a hassle, follow these steps:</p>
<div class="section" id="preparatory-setup">
<h2>Preparatory Setup</h2>
<p>It is assumed you are using <strong>distribute</strong> and <strong>pip</strong> to install
Python packages. This means, you need to have the following setup done
already:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
curl -O http://python-distribute.org/distribute\_setup.py
sudop python distribute\_setup.py
curl -O https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py
sudo python get-pip.py
</pre>
<p>Furthermore, we are assuming a 64 bit build of Python 2.7 as the
target environment. If you only need/want to use a stack compiled for a
32 bit architecture, simpler paths than the one laid out here might work
as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="numpy">
<h2><a class="reference external" href="http://www.numpy.org/">NumPy</a></h2>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/NumPy/">Download and install</a> a version of numpy that is not too new
(currently, 1.6 worked, while numpy-dev is at 1.8) for the latest
version of OSX and the oldest still supported version of Python
(currently, 2.7) to have any chance of success.</p>
<p>The &quot;newest&quot; NumPy package that was found to work was the numpy-1.6.2
package for Python 2.7, while when using any newer package, the
post-installation check in the Python interpreter:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; import numpy; numpy.test('full')
</pre>
<p>did not pass without errors. What you never want to be seeing are
errors directly related to the Fortran compiler. This would probably
mean that you have your own version of Fortran installed; The best
remedy in that case is to remove it and the tests should pass.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="scipy">
<h2><a class="reference external" href="http://www.scipy.org/SciPy">SciPy</a></h2>
<p>Again, <a class="reference external" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/scipy/files/scipy/">fetch a version</a> where not too many tests fail (and even on
Ubuntu LTS 12.04, the tests &quot;test_io.test_imread&quot; and &quot;test_expon&quot;
are known too fail and are considered to be a non-issue). On OSX 10.7
with Python 2.7, it is possible to install the 0.10.1 package and the
final:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; import scipy; scipy.test()
</pre>
<p>check passes with &quot;only&quot; 9 failures. If you use newer versions, more
tests will fail. In general, these two core libraries are the hardest
part and it is essential to get particularly NumPy installed correctly
for everything else to work.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="matplotlib">
<h2><a class="reference external" href="http://matplotlib.org/">MatPlotLib</a></h2>
<p>The next step is the installation of matplotlib; There are
<a class="reference external" href="http://matplotlib.org/downloads.html">pre-compiled OSX packages</a> for Python 2.7 available, and the latest
version (1.2.0 at the time of this writing) should work without any
trouble. To ensure the installation worked, try this in the Python
interpreter:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; from pylab import \*; plot([1,2,3]); show()
</pre>
<p>and you should see a plot with a straight diagonal. To ensure you have
the right library, also check:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; import matlpotlib; matplotlib.\_\_version\_\_
</pre>
<p>And you should see the desired version number you were trying to
install.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ipython">
<h2><a class="reference external" href="http://ipython.org/">IPython</a></h2>
<p>First of all, a different readline installation is necessary:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
sudo easy\_install-2.7 readline
</pre>
<p>Note that readline has to be installed using easy_install, not pip!</p>
<p>Now, the default installation way should work and we can simply do:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
sudo pip install ipython[zmq,qtconsole,notebook,test]
</pre>
<p>To make sure the installation worked, execute the newly installed
iptest script.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="scikit-learn">
<h2><a class="reference external" href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/">Scikit-Learn</a></h2>
<p>This again is pretty straightforward; Do:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
sudo pip install scikit-learn
nosetests sklearn --exe
</pre>
<p>This nosetest will produce one (and only one) error: &quot;Split arrays or
matrices into random train and test subsets&quot;. But <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/1648">according to the
developer</a>, this is a non-issue and can be ignored.</p>
<p>Last, if you are interested in using two more experimental and novel
libraries on Python that are attempting to rid the requirement of using
R (and/or rpy), you might want to install Pandas and StatsModels. If you
prefer non-experimental, production stable libraries, you are probably
advised to use R and RPy2, as RPy (&quot;version 1&quot;) often tends to have
issues.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pandas">
<h2><a class="reference external" href="http://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a></h2>
<p>(Python Data Analysis Library) Again, the default installation route
should work:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
sudo pip install pandas
</pre>
<p>To ensure the library is operational, run (should not produce any
errors):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
nosetests pandas
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="statsmodels">
<h2><a class="reference external" href="http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/">StatsModels</a></h2>
<p>As with Pandas, we can use the &quot;default installation pathway&quot;, but
need to first install an undocumented dependency for this module
(patsy):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
sudo pip install patsy
sudo pip install statsmodels
</pre>
<p>To check the installation worked, open a Python interpreter session
and do:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; import statsmodels.api as sm
&gt;&gt;&gt; sm.test()
</pre>
<p>Here, several tests seem to be failing and it is not clear at all if
this is expected or not. StatsModels has several hundreds of open issues
and should probably be considered very experimental at this stage.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rpy2">
<h2><a class="reference external" href="http://rpy.sourceforge.net/">RPy2</a></h2>
<p>Again, the standard installation works (assuming you have R itself
installed already, at least!):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
sudo pip install rpy2
</pre>
<p>To ensure the install worked, run the tests as:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
python -m 'rpy2.tests'
</pre>
<p>You should not be seeing any problems.</p>
<p><em>E voilà</em> - you now have a fully functioning environment for running
all kinds and sorts of statistical data analyses and machine learning
algorithms!</p>

                <div class="post">
                    <h2 class="title">
                        <a href="http://fnl.es/mobileme-vs-sugarsync-vs-dropbox.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to &quot;MobileMe vs. SugarSync vs. DropBox&quot;">MobileMe vs. SugarSync vs. DropBox</a>
                    </h2>
                    
                    <p>I now have tested MobileMe, SugarSync, and DropBox for quite a while to
decide which service to buy for syncing my “electronic life” between my
Macs (soon I’ll be managing two OSX Server blades, one Mini, and two
MBPs!). After this period, there is no doubt to me: I’m syncing my iCal
calendars and Address Book content via Google, my bookmarks with XMarks,
and everything else via DropBox.</p>
<p>MobileMe’s iDisk is nothing more than a pain and a piece of junk, which
I honestly did not expect. After all the problems they had last year
launching Me.com, I thought they would have by now created a working
service. But the iDisk and syncing my PIM (Personal Information Manager
- I still use Yojimbo, as Evernote’s and Together’s handling of
encryption are pure patched add-ons) was just a [bad] joke: You even
need to buy extra software if you want to do file syncing, as iDisk’s
“offline” sync is so slow and error prone I could not believe Apple
dares to offer something like that. So you need to either use Lingon and
rsync to sync to your online mode iDisk which doesn’t win a medal for
simplicity, or buy something like ChronoSync - and that takes hours
(!!!) to ensure 10 GB of data in about 30-40k Files are synced, <strong>every
time</strong>. All the more, ChronoSync may be the fastest and safest syncer in
the wild! What finally got me mad was the sync agent using 90% CPU all
of the time, at times virtually locking you out of your own machine,
while performing almost nothing. Finally, if you ever try to navigate
that online iDisk, get yourself a cup of tea, you will have plenty of
time to drink it up until that file is open…</p>
<p>Compared to SugarSync, DropBox with its simplicity and real versioning
of files is significantly better performing than SugarSync, espcially if
we talk upload and real volume, and if you ever tried SugarSync, it is a
resource hugger (not as bad as iDisk, but it will stop your workflow).
So in the end the choice for me was based on “mutual exclusion”, there
is simply still no service that can hold the candle to DropBox - and
just got me Pro account. As I am writing this, I am syncing up dozens of
gigs of data to my 50 GB DropBox, and I hardly notice it happening!</p>
<p>Oh, if you get yourself an account for DropBox, either the free 2 GB or
a full Pro account, I would appreciate if you register via <a class="reference external" href="https://www.getdropbox.com/referrals/NTE0NTA0OTk">this link</a>,
as it creates me some 500 MB extra space for referring you :o).</p>
