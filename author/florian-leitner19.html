                    </h2>

                    <p>In the last few weeks I had been to Cadiz and Almeria, both in
the south of Spain. Well, actually I was in none of those cities, but in
places close by.</p>
<p>The first trip together with Gema was down to Cadiz, about 30 km south
of the city some of Gemas friends were renting a flat in <a class="reference external" href="http://maps.google.es/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Conil,+Spain&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=11&amp;om=1">Conil</a>, a
village nearby. South of Cadiz you basically find the probably most
beautiful beaches of Spain, at least that was my impression and what my
Spanish friends told me (and, on a side note, the most incredible amount
of beautiful girls, too...). The only downside is that it can be kind of
windy, but if you know it, just bring some very stable wind protection,
and you should be fine. Actually, the one day it was windy, I was quite
happy, because with the burning sun having a swim and then cooling in
the breeze is a real relief. We also visited Tarifa, one of the main
wind- and kite surfing sites of Europe. You never saw a village so small
just full of surf shops - if you ask me, more dense than the skiing
shops in the tourist-trap villages in Tirol. Also we spent some time in
Los Caños de Meca, right between Conil and Tarifa, which is a real hippy
town and has a cool bar which is made up a bit like a ship deck and is
above a cliff looking out over the Atlantic. Great place to have some
&quot;copas&quot; (drinks)! On our way back to Madrid we took the time to stop in
Cordoba, which might be, together with Sevilla, the hottest (in
temperature, man!) town of Spain. In the center you can visit an
enormous (like in really enormous) mosque, as Cordoba and Granade where
interchangeably the capitals of the Arabian empire during the medieval
ages. Now it houses several (!!!) churches inside and it is really worth
paying the 8 Euros entry. Gema was slightly angry about my cultural
blasphemy, as the first thing that came to my mind upon entering was
&quot;and where is Indiana Jones?&quot;...</p>
<p>The second trip to Almeria in the southeast corner of Spain was
actually for a festival, the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.creamfields-andalucia.com/">Creamfields</a> in Spain. This festival is
exclusively for electronic music, and the lineup were bands and DJs like
Basement Jaxx, The Prodigy, or John Digweed. It's a 14 h festival
&quot;only&quot;, starting at 6 pm and lasting until about 8 am the next morning.
But believe me, that was by far enough for me, and it took me several
days to recover... The greatest thing about this location is that you
have the After Hour right smack on the beach, hanging out in the sun and
taking an occasional bath to cool down. Although it was great, I am not
sure to recommend it again: This year they had 50k visitors, and the
only access is a single little road, which meant we were jamming 2 1/2 h
in the car just to get in, and then another 1/2 h walk from the parking
place to the actual festival. Considering that they have more attendees
every year, I don't want to know how bad it will be next year. So if you
feel like going, I might recommend you come a day earlier and put up
tent there on the beach (actually, better in the wood at the side of the
beach - if you can't imagine why, just do as I recommend...).</p>
<p>So, all in all, two really gorgeous trips around Spain, and I am
looking forward to some more in the days to come this year. The only
thing I could slap my ass for is that I on both occasions forgot to
bring my camera...</p>
