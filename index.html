their workforce were baptized <a class="reference external" href="https://qualitysafety.bmj.com/content/13/suppl_2/ii22">generative
cultures</a> by
Ron Westrum in 2004. This article will describe why
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.lean.org/explore-lean/what-is-lean/">lean</a>, generative
cultures might interest the reader and point out the &quot;secrete sauce&quot; in
creating them: transforming <a class="reference external" href="https://cdn.csu.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/917018/Eight-Behaviors-for-Smarter-Teams-2.pdf">behavior and
communication</a>.
Note that despite having &quot;lean&quot; in the title, the text will deliberately
ignore Lean's &quot;customer value&quot; aspect, focusing on the soft skills
(respect and teamwork) and <strong>Kaizen</strong> (continuous improvement) instead.
Finally, this post concludes with a reasonable way to probe if an
organization has adopted such a culture, no matter if you are inside or
outside that org.</p>
<p>According to Westrum, generative cultures place their utmost value on
the flow of information. One might say they value <strong>transparency</strong> above
all else. The <a class="reference external" href="https://openstax.org/books/principles-management/pages/3-3-the-industrial-revolution">industrial
revolution</a>
came around by ensuring that data flows from the edges (workers/actors)
to the centers (leaders). Even Napoleon's success as a military leader
<a class="reference external" href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/36698436.pdf">has been attributed</a>
to Napoleon creating an efficient flow of intelligence back to central
command and control.</p>
<p>Generative cultures ensure the <em>reverse</em> flow of information back to the
edges, too: In a self-evident example, imagine workers having access to
real-time data about the sale of each type of product made in their
factory. That would allow those workers to make <strong>Agile</strong> production
decisions (i.e., swiftly and independently) without including a long and
tedious communication chain through company silos and hierarchies. The
<a class="reference external" href="https://hbr.org/1990/11/how-i-learned-to-let-my-workers-lead">(sausage) factory
example</a>
also highlights the lean, bottom-up nature of such cultures: Namely, an
organization's ability to build a workforce that can make decisions at
the edges instead of relying on centralized decision-making structures.
That requires that critical information gets to those workers who might
be taking corrective actions based on it without impediment.</p>
<p>Beyond transparency, to cite Westrum, generative cultures exhibit high
cooperation and teamwork with shared accountability, encourage bridging
across organizational silos, follow the practice of Kaizen (continuous
improvement), and provide fertile grounds for novel ideas to thrive. It
requires an organization with high levels of trust among its people and
leaders able to coach their teams on handling disagreements and conflict
to unlock these benefits, thereby <a class="reference external" href="https://itrevolution.com/agile-conversations/">transforming the organization's
culture</a>.</p>
<p>Therefore, the &quot;secret sauce&quot; is all about building engagement and
dependability by gradually giving the workforce more decision-making
authority. Information gets &quot;stuck&quot; if any manager in the company's
reporting chain first has to &quot;call the shots&quot;: Every time that happens,
in the best case, a delay is introduced - and in the worst case,
information is lost. Ultimately, an organization's ability to make the
most optimal decisions and therefore reach the best possible <em>business
outcomes</em> depends on surfacing the relevant data in time at those places
where a change needs to transpire (which is, most often, at the edges).</p>
<p>Building such an enabled workforce requires a leadership team that
trusts and respects its people.
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.leanblog.org/2013/02/toyota-respect-for-people-or-humanity-and-lean/">Respect</a>
refers to one of the five Lean values: Having a psychologically safe
environment where leaders coach their teams in decision-making while
providing all the necessary data. And <a class="reference external" href="https://www.tablegroup.com/the-five-dysfunctions-of-a-team-trust/">(Lencioni's vulnerability-based)
trust</a>,
among other things, implies that the leader is willing to rely on the
team to make the right decisions instead of the leader making those
decisions unilaterally. In other words, it requires leaders to face
their ego and overcome inner fears by <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOiP4mJwqE0">conceding decision-making powers
to their reports (&quot;Brave New
Work&quot;)</a>. Furthermore, it
requires a leadership behavior that allows curiosity and collaboration
to foster. That, in turn, needs managers with a broad range of abilities
and a coaching mindset:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The ability to create a psychologically safe learning environment and
teach <a class="reference external" href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mrother/The_Improvement_Kata.html">continual
self-improvement</a>;</li>
<li>The ability to coach people on how to approach problems in a
data-driven way to generate optimal solutions <em>as a team</em>;</li>
<li>Making all relevant information available while eradicating &quot;the
undiscussable&quot; (Anything that a team should talk about but only
get addressed in hallways, 1on1s, or among smaller groups.)</li>
<li>Plus all the <a class="reference external" href="https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/managers-identify-what-makes-a-great-manager/steps/learn-about-googles-manager-research/">&quot;standard&quot;
ingredients</a>
that make up a great manager, such as providing structure &amp;
clarity, accountability, meaning, and impact.</li>
</ul>
<p>While the reader might agree with all of the above, it can be a long
path for an untrained person to acquire those skills. When I first
encountered these ideas, I believed that I was practicing them already,
only to discover that I was (and in some areas very much still am)
nowhere close after a more detailed introspection of my behavior.
Anyhow, the above description and links should provide the interested
reader with more than sufficient material to take that path. Instead, in
this blog post, I would like to conclude with an exciting way to probe
if you, your team, your company, or even the company you are
interviewing with is building a lean, generative culture.</p>
<p>The test is a short set of questions that you can ask, in any context,
as a self-test, when talking to your future manager or out of general
curiosity:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Transparency</strong> and information flow: People should be willing to
disagree when they see things differently and openly share how
they come to their views. Can you give some examples of how your
team navigates disagreements and makes decisions? Can you explain
how you increase teamwork among your reports?</li>
<li><strong>Curiosity</strong> and continuous improvement: Teams should have a mutual
learning mindset and be eager to improve continually. Can you
provide concrete examples of how your team improves itself and
learns together? What is the most exciting thing your team worked
on or researched recently, and what did you learn?</li>
<li><strong>Accountability</strong> and dependability: Everyone on the team should be
encouraged to take full responsibility for their words, actions,
and results. Can you give me examples of how you ensure that your
people can depend on each other? How do you motivate people to
participate in meetings, take on responsibilities, and grow?</li>
<li><strong>Core values</strong> and more Kaizen: What do you see as the
organization's most significant strengths and weaknesses, and how
are you acting on those insights?</li>
</ul>
<p>The above questions are the &quot;probes&quot; I have designed to keep asking
myself and track if I am improving as a leader. While I at least believe
that the remaining core lean, generative culture values (compassion,
respect, and trust) must be present if you can answer the above
questions satisfactorily. I am sure the questions are not pixel perfect,
so I would greatly welcome all constructive criticism if you see
cleverer ways to design this test.</p>
