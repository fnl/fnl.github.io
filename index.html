                    <p>After months of looking for a loophole in my calendar to migrate my rather outdated and mostly untended Blogger site to something more modern, I have found the ideal timing: The birth and arrival of my son, Alexander LV (<a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/AlexThe55th">&#64;AlexThe55th</a>)!
(Because here in Spain even daddies get two to three weeks off.)</p>
<img alt="Alexander taking a sun bath." src="http://fnl.es/static/images/13-07-01_initial-alexander.jpg" style="width: 75%;" />
<p>I will reduce the amount of personal entries and augment the articles about (mostly biological) data mininig issues, in particular related to text mining and software engineering.
Now and then I intend to throw in some issues about privacy, human rights, travelling and all those other things that interest me and make life worth living.</p>
<p>As blogging framework I have decided to move on to <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a>, because it is <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>-based, generating extremely light-weight static pages from <a class="reference external" href="http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html">ReST</a> files.
This allows me to easily maintain the blog from any terminal and its pythonic origins allow me to hack the framework if need be.</p>

                        <a href="http://fnl.es/installing-a-full-stack-python-data-analysis-environment-on-osx.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to &quot;Installing a full stack Python data analysis environment on OSX&quot;">Installing a full stack Python data analysis environment on OSX</a>
                    </h2>
                    
                    <p>It is a bit of an effort to install the latest <strong>numpy</strong> and <strong>scipy</strong>
libraries due to their dependencies on Fortran libraries, while Apple is
(was? ...) mostly neglecting all Fortran issues. Furthermore, when
trying to compile a collection of these libraries for Python 3k and 64
bit, all these headaches seem to magnify enough so that attempting to
use them with Py3k on OSX has to be very much discouraged by the author.
Getting NumPy to work on 64 bit with Py3k and playing nicely the various
&quot;high-level&quot; libraries and the R environment can become a nightmare on a
Mac. If you really need to use Py3k, but are married to OSX, you are
probably better off installing a virtual machine with your favorite
Linux distro than trying to get this ensemble to work natively. In other
words, OSX is not a good platform for scientific computing, and you are
living easier with what is available - unless you prefer spending your
time on tinkering over productivity. You have been warned…</p>
<p>This guide will outline how to install the following Python software
stack:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>NumPy (1.6.2)</li>
<li>SciPy (0.10.1)</li>
<li>MatPlotLib (1.2.0)</li>
<li>IPython (0.13.2)</li>
<li>Scikit-Learn (0.13)</li>
<li>RPy2 (2.3.2)</li>
</ul>
<p>Optional instructions to install the two &quot;new kids on the block&quot;,
Pandas and StatsModels, are provided, too. To get a 64 bit version of
all this software installed on OSX 10.6 through 10.8 that does work &quot;out
of the box&quot; (although admittedly not optimally due to the Fortran
issues!) without too much of a hassle, follow these steps:</p>
<div class="section" id="preparatory-setup">
<h2>Preparatory Setup</h2>
<p>It is assumed you are using <strong>distribute</strong> and <strong>pip</strong> to install
Python packages. This means, you need to have the following setup done
already:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
curl -O http://python-distribute.org/distribute\_setup.py
sudop python distribute\_setup.py
curl -O https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py
sudo python get-pip.py
</pre>
<p>Furthermore, we are assuming a 64 bit build of Python 2.7 as the
target environment. If you only need/want to use a stack compiled for a
32 bit architecture, simpler paths than the one laid out here might work
as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="numpy">
<h2><a class="reference external" href="http://www.numpy.org/">NumPy</a></h2>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/NumPy/">Download and install</a> a version of numpy that is not too new
(currently, 1.6 worked, while numpy-dev is at 1.8) for the latest
version of OSX and the oldest still supported version of Python
(currently, 2.7) to have any chance of success.</p>
<p>The &quot;newest&quot; NumPy package that was found to work was the numpy-1.6.2
package for Python 2.7, while when using any newer package, the
post-installation check in the Python interpreter:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; import numpy; numpy.test('full')
</pre>
<p>did not pass without errors. What you never want to be seeing are
errors directly related to the Fortran compiler. This would probably
mean that you have your own version of Fortran installed; The best
remedy in that case is to remove it and the tests should pass.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="scipy">
<h2><a class="reference external" href="http://www.scipy.org/SciPy">SciPy</a></h2>
<p>Again, <a class="reference external" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/scipy/files/scipy/">fetch a version</a> where not too many tests fail (and even on
Ubuntu LTS 12.04, the tests &quot;test_io.test_imread&quot; and &quot;test_expon&quot;
are known too fail and are considered to be a non-issue). On OSX 10.7
with Python 2.7, it is possible to install the 0.10.1 package and the
final:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; import scipy; scipy.test()
</pre>
<p>check passes with &quot;only&quot; 9 failures. If you use newer versions, more
tests will fail. In general, these two core libraries are the hardest
part and it is essential to get particularly NumPy installed correctly
for everything else to work.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="matplotlib">
<h2><a class="reference external" href="http://matplotlib.org/">MatPlotLib</a></h2>
<p>The next step is the installation of matplotlib; There are
<a class="reference external" href="http://matplotlib.org/downloads.html">pre-compiled OSX packages</a> for Python 2.7 available, and the latest
version (1.2.0 at the time of this writing) should work without any
trouble. To ensure the installation worked, try this in the Python
interpreter:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; from pylab import \*; plot([1,2,3]); show()
</pre>
<p>and you should see a plot with a straight diagonal. To ensure you have
the right library, also check:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; import matlpotlib; matplotlib.\_\_version\_\_
</pre>
<p>And you should see the desired version number you were trying to
install.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ipython">
<h2><a class="reference external" href="http://ipython.org/">IPython</a></h2>
<p>First of all, a different readline installation is necessary:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
sudo easy\_install-2.7 readline
</pre>
<p>Note that readline has to be installed using easy_install, not pip!</p>
<p>Now, the default installation way should work and we can simply do:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
sudo pip install ipython[zmq,qtconsole,notebook,test]
</pre>
<p>To make sure the installation worked, execute the newly installed
iptest script.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="scikit-learn">
<h2><a class="reference external" href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/">Scikit-Learn</a></h2>
<p>This again is pretty straightforward; Do:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
sudo pip install scikit-learn
nosetests sklearn --exe
</pre>
<p>This nosetest will produce one (and only one) error: &quot;Split arrays or
matrices into random train and test subsets&quot;. But <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/1648">according to the
developer</a>, this is a non-issue and can be ignored.</p>
<p>Last, if you are interested in using two more experimental and novel
libraries on Python that are attempting to rid the requirement of using
R (and/or rpy), you might want to install Pandas and StatsModels. If you
prefer non-experimental, production stable libraries, you are probably
advised to use R and RPy2, as RPy (&quot;version 1&quot;) often tends to have
issues.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pandas">
<h2><a class="reference external" href="http://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a></h2>
<p>(Python Data Analysis Library) Again, the default installation route
should work:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
sudo pip install pandas
</pre>
<p>To ensure the library is operational, run (should not produce any
errors):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
nosetests pandas
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="statsmodels">
<h2><a class="reference external" href="http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/">StatsModels</a></h2>
<p>As with Pandas, we can use the &quot;default installation pathway&quot;, but
need to first install an undocumented dependency for this module
(patsy):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
sudo pip install patsy
sudo pip install statsmodels
</pre>
<p>To check the installation worked, open a Python interpreter session
and do:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; import statsmodels.api as sm
&gt;&gt;&gt; sm.test()
</pre>
<p>Here, several tests seem to be failing and it is not clear at all if
this is expected or not. StatsModels has several hundreds of open issues
and should probably be considered very experimental at this stage.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rpy2">
<h2><a class="reference external" href="http://rpy.sourceforge.net/">RPy2</a></h2>
<p>Again, the standard installation works (assuming you have R itself
installed already, at least!):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
sudo pip install rpy2
</pre>
<p>To ensure the install worked, run the tests as:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
python -m 'rpy2.tests'
</pre>
<p>You should not be seeing any problems.</p>
<p><em>E voilà</em> - you now have a fully functioning environment for running
all kinds and sorts of statistical data analyses and machine learning
algorithms!</p>

                    </h2>
                    
                    <p>I just had a rough time figuring out how to bypass all the security
features of the Rails project I am developing to write decent controller
specs with RSpec. I am using AuthLogic as authentication module and
declarative authorization (DA) for exactly that. However, when I started
to write controller specs that would simulate (HTTP) GET requests, I ran
into a wall: I simply could not digg what the cleanest way would be to
bypass both AuthLogic and DA. Finally, after finding the right queries
in Google, I managed to get the necessary snippets. To avoid that the
same tedious task might befall you, here's what you need to add, e.g.,
to your spec_helpers directory - I called the file
&quot;controller_helpers.rb&quot;:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
module SessionHelper
  def current_user(stubs = {})
    &#64;current_user ||= mock_model(User, stubs)
  end

  def user_session(stubs = {}, user_stubs = {})
    &#64;current_user_session ||= mock_model(
      UserSession, { :user =&gt; current_user(user_stubs) }.merge(stubs)
    )
  end

  def login(session_stubs = {}, user_stubs = {})
    UserSession.stub!(:find).and_return(
      user_session(session_stubs, user_stubs)
    )
  end

  def logout()
    &#64;user_session = nil
  end

  def disable_authorization()
    Authorization.ignore_access_control(true)
  end
end
</pre>
<p>The trick is that, for AuthLogic, you can now &quot;authenticate&quot; the user
by the stubbed UserSession that returns a mocked User model. DA is less
complicated: the <tt class="docutils literal">disable_authorization()</tt> method is all that is
needed. Now, in your &quot;spec_helper.rb&quot;, you add this line to the top:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
require File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/spec_helpers/controller_helpers'
</pre>
<p>And this line somewhere in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Spec::Runner.configure</span></tt> loop:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
config.include(SessionHelper)
</pre>
<p>Now, in your controller specs, it is more than trivial to disable
authorization and authentication at once - simply add the following
line, e.g., to your <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">before(:each)</span></tt> definitions:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
disable_authorization &amp;&amp; login
</pre>
<p>Voila - your GET requests pass; and you can even add stubs to your
User model, if needed, by adding them as key-value pairs to the
<tt class="docutils literal">login()</tt> call above! So now you can get back to make your specs
pass...</p>
