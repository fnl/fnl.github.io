                    </h2>
                    
                    <p>Usually, I prefer to steer free from the day-to-day mainstream news, yet
even I have to accept a low level of &quot;noise&quot; if I want to know at least
something about the most significant things going on. However, currently
I get the overwhelming feeling that the whole news world is grunting and
snorting like a pigsty. You guessed it, I am concerned about all this
&quot;swine flu&quot; reporting going on. As can be easily demonstrated, this
whole &quot;pandemic alert&quot; and panic-making has gone completely out of
proportion. It is yet another example of how ridiculous news agencies
exaggerate or even blur the facts, and this attitude might be much more
lethal than most biological illnesses if measured by its indirect
impact.</p>
<p>First of, some flu virus classification: There are three types of
influenza virus: A, B, and C. B and C play only very minor roles as they
mutate slower, are less virulent, and affect far less species. Usually,
when talking about a flu virus, type A is implied. Type A influenza then
is further categorized by the HxNx nomenclature. The H refers to the
hemagglutinin (HA) lectin and the N to the neuroaminidase (NA)
glycoprotein. Both are found on the outside coat of the virus particle.
HA mediates the virus' binding to target cells, while NA is responsible
for the release of progeny virus from infected host cells. The numbers
denote the antibody response of the virus, ordered by historic discovery
- meaning, a virus with the same H/N number is identified by the same
<em>type</em> of antibodies, which form part of your immune system/defense. HA
and NA are essential for the virulence (the relative ability to cause
disease) in terms of infectiveness and the epidemic capabilities of the
strain. H1N1 denotes the class of flu virus HA/NA proteins that is the
most commonly found form in human influenza. Our immune system defends
us by recognizing mainly those two proteins (the &quot;antigenes&quot;) through
our antibodies. This means, from a pure immuno-defense point of view,
this kind of strain is the most well known to the human body and immune
system. This is one of the reasons why the new Hong Kong avian flu, with
its H5N1 composition, is much more virulent than the current H1N1 swine
flu or any other &quot;regular&quot; flu.</p>
<p>Endemic states and lethal properties: H1N1 most deadly appearance and
the worst pandemic in modern human history was what we now know as the
&quot;Spanish Flu&quot; in 1918; This specific influenza virus transformed its
endemic properties (the ability to propagate within one kind of species,
in this case birds) to a panzootic state (affecting animals including
humans - epizootic would be the intermediate state that does not affect
humans). Note that this pandemic occurred during WW I, largely
facilitating its spread. In general, any kind of virus capable of
overcoming the species barrier is potentially more dangerous, as it is
likely to carry genetic material and protein structures the newly
infected species has never seen before, therefor being much more
virulent and lethal than the existing endemic strains. However, the
Spanish Flu killed somewhere around 20 million people (taking
conservative, low estimates), and its symptoms were so strong it was
often misdiagnosed as some much more severe infection. Apart from the
HA/NA properties already mentioned, there is the actual RNA (viruses
commonly use RNA instead of DNA to carry their genetic information) that
a virus uses to encode its proteins and other functions that are
important to the survival and impact of a virus. Our immune defense
looks for RNA sequences those are different to any sequence found in our
body and &quot;destroys&quot; those foreign sequences by cleaving the strands into
non-functional pieces with the help of so-called RNases. For this to
work, the immune system therefor has to identify the RNA [as foreign].
But a strand of RNA coming from another species might actually contain
nucleotide base sequences our immune system does not recognize (because
it only recognizes already <em>known</em> foreign sequences), making the virus
much more lethal. This process of changing the RNA and protein
configuration is amplified by two related mechanisms called &quot;genetic
drift&quot; and &quot;antigenic shift&quot;. In the case of the Spanish flu, the RNA
was very &quot;new&quot; to the human's immune system and had a very high mutation
rate: how often the RNA sequence changes, roughly the meaning of the
aforementioned genetic drift and antigenic shift. On the contrary, the
new &quot;Mexican&quot; swine flu virus has a very similar RNA composition to
regular virus strains found in humans, i.e. it does not appear to be
significantly more leathal than any other flu. The only known difference
to the regular flu circulating in humans is that it seems to affect more
younger than older people, possibly due to the fact that older people's
immune systems already have &quot;seen&quot; a similar version of this virus some
time ago and therefor have antibodies that recognize the HA/NA
glycoproteins.</p>
<p>Now compare this swine flu against any regular flu by numbers: The
regular flu kills about 250,000 to <em>half a million</em> people <em>per year</em>.
This overhyped swine flu managed to kill <em>eight</em> (8!) humans so far and
it has been confirmed to have infected about 150 people worldwide (WHO
data, 29th of April, 2009). I.e., on a daily average about a
<strong>thousand times more</strong> people die from the regular flu than this new
strain. Regular flu is almost continuously spreading somewhere in the
world, i.e., if the WHO took this into account, we would be living in a
nearly constant influenza pandemic. The swine flu just now made it to
the last stage before <em>even being defined</em> as a WHO &quot;pandemic&quot;: There
must be a few known infections in at least two countries. Recall this
definition and check the real numbers when somebody is talking about a
new &quot;pandemic&quot;. The infection with swine flu seems to be no more lethal
than with any other flu, so your chances of dying from the swine flu
outside of Mexico are so marginal it makes no sense to take them into
account, while if you do go to Mexico, all you seriously need to do is
make sure your current health state is good enough to survive any flu
anywhere, which is much more prevalent and 1,000 times more likely to
kill you by a global statistic<em>.</em> But the main point is: there is
nothing dangerous or wrong about going to Mexico, at least concerning
the flu. I would be much more worried about drug gangsters and hijackers
there if I were you: They managed to kill several thousands of people
this year alone already. In other words, the WHO rulings and
suggestions, that are close to ridiculous given the circumstances,
combined with the media hype are about to isolate Mexico from the world,
which leads me to my final and most important point.</p>
<p>In general, this &quot;pig-hyped&quot; flu without any review of its background,
no factual content, and exclusively based on beliefs and propaganda has
only one really worrisome influence: it is weakening and isolating
Mexico, both socially and economically. Our ignorance to real facts are
estimated to cost Mexico <em>City</em> (&quot;D.F.&quot;) alone around $88 million <em>per
day</em>, and this figure will need huge updates for the crash Mexico's main
(legal) economic sector, tourism, will suffer, plus the costs incurred
on the country as a whole. This number will be similar to or more likely
even exceed the daily cost of the U.S. oil war in Irak (estimated to
about $250 million, in case you didn't know) - the only good news being
that instead of about 100 (direct, not counting the indirect toll, which
is estimated to be around five times higher) deaths per day, the swine
flu's daily death toll is still below one. In other words, the combined
direct and indirect negative impact of this insubstantial media hype on
a close to imaginary &quot;Mexican Flu&quot; will cost and destroy much more lives
than the virus itself most likely ever will have been capable of. Media
propaganda crusades against a country nowadays have the same
socioeconomic impact as the largest &quot;real&quot; war in decades if measured by
the daily cost. Keep this in mind the next time you read news about
swines from pigs.</p>

                    </h2>
                    
                    <p>This change in Python 3.0 might be more than useful for
anybody intending to write programs that use more than the ASCII
characters (A-z, 0-9, and some symbols), which, given how i18n'ed most
applications are today, is rather the norm than the exception. I also
hope to encourage my fellow Pythoneers to update to 3.0 as soon as
humanly possible, not only because of this change, but because of the
general advantages of Python 3.0 (aka &quot;no-where near 3000&quot;...).</p>
<p>In case you do not understand the difference between Unicode and String
arrays, here is a short paragraph to get you started. A String (str in
pre-3.0 Python, bytes/bytearray in Python 3.x+) is a byte-array already
<em>bound</em> to a specific character-lookup table (e.g. ASCII, Latin-1,
UTF-8, etc.) to find the correct representation for that String. Note
that this is not the <em>glyph</em> itself you see on-screen, as this depends
on, e.g., what font you are using, and is handled by the GUI toolkit or
the terminal. A Unicode array (unicode in pre-3.0, str in 3.x+) on the
other hand is an array of &quot;universal&quot; bytes, so-called <strong>code-points</strong>
usually managed as two-byte arrays, but has no native representation.
Therefore, to create something readable from an Unicode object, you have
to <em>encode</em> its bytes by using a codetable, such as ASCII or UTF-16, to
the correct String representation (&quot;<em>bind</em> the Unicode array to a code
table&quot;). On the contrary, to create a Unicode array from a String array,
you need to <em>decode</em> (&quot;unbind&quot;) the String's coding to get the
&quot;universal&quot; (in quotation marks as not all programming langues have to
use base 16 integers (aka hex, or two bytes)) Unicode. If you are not
used to thinking in these terms, a general tip for pre-3.0 Python: your
program should, when handling String input (SAX parsers for example
already do the conversion for you), convert it to Unicode (decode the
Strings), and when outputing your Unicode arrays, convert them back to
the desired String representation (encode them) - while working with
Unicode internally to avoid bugs and possible exploits. A (rather
stupid, but you can interpolate the danger, I hope) snippet from
Python's Unicode HOWTO might exemplify this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
def read_file(filename, encoding):
    if '/' in filename:
        raise ValueError(u&quot;'/' not allowed in filename&quot;)
    else:
        return open(filename.decode(encoding), 'r')
</pre>
<p>Looks good at first, but what about sending that function a String not
in any standard encoding? For example, the UTF-7 encoding for
u&quot;/etc/passwd&quot; is &quot;+AC8-etc+AC8-passwd&quot; - a nasty mistake if that file
is presented to a user... (the work-around in this trivial example is
obvious: just decode before the if-clause - or, even better, when the
string enters your program - and compare to u'/'). To summarize, in
Python (not so in C, for example!) a Unicode array consists of two-byte
elements (base 16 integers) called code-points, Strings are arrays of
bytes which are bound to a codetable that helps the Python interpreter
look up the bytes' character representations and send them to your
terminal or GUI. Unicode to String conversion is called encoding
(&quot;binding&quot;), String to Unicode conversion is decoding (&quot;unbinding&quot;). The
fact that, when using the Python shell, you see &quot;real&quot; characters for a
String or Unicode object is pure convenience and should not distract you
from how they truly work internally.</p>
<p>After this lengthy Unicode vs. String intro, the best news first: if you
can allow yourself the luxury to program with any Python version and are
not dependent on external libraries, Python 3.0 is just made for you:
The new native String object is always a Unicode representation, and the
default encoding chosen for representing your strings is UTF-8. In other
words, if you use Python 3.0 and are happy with UTF-8, you no longer
have to worry about decoding your (byte) strings to Unicode arrays or
binding your Unicode code-points to the right (byte-) string
representations. While this might seem like something that should have
been done long ago, for historic reasons older programming languages
(plus Python pre-3.0) use ASCII as the default encoding, meaning you had
to look after de-/encoding the whole time when working with input/output
functionality of your programs and using most other languages other than
English - and even there you might want to have special characters
(don't be so naïve...). Sad side to this: what I am talking about here
is standard in Java...</p>
<p>However, you no longer need to worry with 3.0: First, the totally
useless old String object (str) has been removed (to be exact, it could
be said it is now &quot;integrated&quot; into the bytes and bytearray objects),
including the even more ridiculous &quot;encode&quot; method for old str objects:
bytes and bytearray only support a &quot;decode&quot; message (to the new Unicode
str objects), while the intended use of str.encode, transforming Byte
objects that were represented as str objects in pre-3.0, like zip or
base64, now has to be done through a new method called &quot;translate&quot; on
the new bytes and bytearray objects in 3.0, or via encode on the new str
object. This was a dangerous duck typing strategy to have str.encode in
pre-3.0: as Unicode objects can and should have this method, too, but as
you could not tell if you were calling encode on a Unicode object or a
String object (without something like writing:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
assert isinstance(my_obj, unicode)
</pre>
<p>before every call to encode, at least), you could have been decoding
Unicode and encoding Strings - and because Python was (yes, was (!) -
see below) as &quot;nice&quot; as to do auto-coercion for you, without very
thorough testing libraries such a bug could go unnoticed for a long time
in pre-3.0. So, my praise to whomever was responsible for that decision!</p>
<p>On the other hand, the unicode object is now the new str object, sans
the even more useless and dangerous &quot;decode&quot; functionality: the new
(Unicode) str object only supports str.encode (for cases where you want
something else than UTF-8), while str.decode is finally dropped from the
Python Standarad Library. Obviously, you might have a system that does
not want UTF-8, and encoding your Unicode str to whatever schema you
need with str.encode the whole time would be a pain; To define a
different encoding globally, Python uses your &quot;coding&quot; declaration in
the first lines of your program as the default encoding schema for all
your new, shiny Unicode str objects. I.e., writing:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
# -*- coding: funny-arab-dialect -*-
</pre>
<p>will be enough if you have some strange language sporting glyphs that
require characters not found in the Unicode consortium's codetables, or
you might want to set it back to ASCII (the default in pre-3.0) if you
really need to ensure nothing other than good, old &quot;7-bit&quot; is output by
your program. On a side note: UTF-8 is compatible with ASCII, while
UTF-16 is not; i.e., an ASCII string encoded using the UTF-8 codetable
still gives the right characters, trying this with UTF-16 encoding does
not - and a good explanation why we have still not moved to UTF-16 in
general.</p>
<p>Finally, the really dangerous auto-coercion of Python between Strings,
Unicode representations, and Byte arrays is gone for good. Your
message's argument types must now match the receiving object's type and
comparisons between the different types always evaluate to false. This
last change might sound drastic if seen from a purely rapid prototyping
view, but everybody with some intent on not going crazy while
programming will greatly appreciate this change. The bugs and exploits
stemming from wrong (en/de-) coding, or, let's say, too much duck typing
the str and unicode objects in pre-3.0 Python (yeah, I love to put the
fault on somebody else...) are finally gone! Also, as all Strings are
now represented as Unicode str objects, you no longer need to worry if,
while comparing two str objects, they are using the same encoding -
which was another fountain of bugs in pre-3.0 Python - as any String is
internally managed as universal Unicode.</p>
<p>What is left to say? These changes are dramatic (even if they should
have been made already long ago with 2.0), and it will take a while
until Python 3.0 will have replaced 2.7 (the final, upcoming stable 2.x
release, which will warn you about code that will break with 3.0). But
the message should be clear: the effort of converting your libraries to
the next generation of Python is more than worth it, and the 2to3
converter should help if you had your encoding/decoding correct. If not,
converting to 3.0 might help you uncover some nasty bugs you were not
even aware of! Other reasons to &quot;convert&quot; would be:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>no more longs, which are now ints and unlimited in size (think of
what happend when reaching maxint before...),</li>
<li>generator/views from most operations formerly returning lists (think:
time used for creating and garbage collecting those temporary lists),</li>
<li>function annotations for metaclassing and advanced decorators,</li>
<li>nonlocal scope (similar to LISPs lexical scope),</li>
<li>dictionary comprehensions (&quot;{k: v for k, v in my_dict}&quot;) and set
literals (&quot;my_set = {1, 2}&quot;),</li>
<li>and tons of streamlining the syntax and Standard Library.</li>

                    <p>I just sent a mail to some of my friends of whom I hope they might be
interested in this subject. I am sure this will be a very hot topic in
certain circles very soon; So I was giving this some thought if I should
publish this entry on my blog or not. My final conclusion is that I give
a damn if anybody can, will, must, etc. associate me with the content of
this documentary I am describing and linking to here. I just think it is
to important for humanity - and much more than 10to100 if you allow me
this joke and understand it because you followed the news lately - than
that it should be a question of my personal integrity needing
protection, as the content is <strong>highly controversial</strong> and more
anarchistic in its nature than anything I have encountered in my life so
far.</p>
<p>However, before reading on, I want to remind you that you are a free
person and as such are free to stop reading this blog or watching the
documentary to which I will be linking you at any time - I think it is
awesome, but I can well imagine you may not. Also, I saw the first
Zeitgeist movie and thought it was rather extreme and not offering any
solutions, just another of these “everything is bad” documentaries we
have out there already, but no real content. Well, this second release
just starts out the same again, and in the first twenty minutes (sorry,
it will take two hours of your time, but if you like what I write here,
I promise you, it’s worth every second) I was very tempted to turn it
down had there not been the financial disaster in the US and my feeling
that this documentary might give me some answers. I promise you,
watching this movie will do way more than letting you understand what
just has happened the last two weeks. Enough bla-bla, let’s see what you
might be into and if you want to see it.</p>
<p>First, Zeitgeist: Addendum (which I think should be called
Revelation…) will explain the current situation of the world and how
things tie up to the situation we are in. If you do not understand this
part, you might want to look at the first Zeitgeist, but it is actually
irrelevant to the cause. The second part speaks straight from my heart,
and what I, too, believe is true: we - as in humanity - now have the
technology to create a self-sustainable, free, and, most importantly,
equal society. It will also explain you why there is no long-term need
for the military, the police, the government, laws, economy, and many
other things we were trained/taught to believe are unrelenting
(de:unbeugsam, es:irreductible), essential, and necessary elements of
human society. This leads into the third part, showing you something I
have never seen before: a possible future, and - this is why I stated
that I have never seen this before - as a more beautiful vision than I
had imagined even in my wildest dreams. This is probably the most
crucial part of the whole movie: you can accept it or not, and I -
obviously - cannot promise you (for now) that it all will become reality
one day. But allow me to dream… Finally, and this is what makes this
movie so exceptional, it explains you something I was missing in all
these documentaries I have watched so far, even better than just a
possible future: it gives you five very simple tasks to accomplish which
will be more than sufficient to make this future our reality if we reach
a, what they call, “critical mass” - although I still believe it is not
a question of if we do it, just when (as in before we eradicate
ourselves from this universe). OK, enough from me, I think the movie
will either disgust you or whatever, or you will have the feeling I am
just now having: my eyes were never that wide open (and no, yours truly
is not on any drugs as in a similarly named movie ;-)).</p>

<p>The second and maybe much more important link is the one to the Venus
Project itself, which is the core element of this movie. You will much
better understand its implications after watching the movie, but feel
free to give it a look right away. Essentially, TVP is implementing a
post-scarcity economy where transparent, public technology and resource
exchanges have replaced the monetary system and the current market
economy while preserving productivity through cultural and social status
incentives.</p>
