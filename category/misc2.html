                    </h2>
                    
                    <p>Colombia is one of the most magnificent countries I have been so far.
If you know a tiny bit of its history with all the bloody civil wars
which have been almost continuously tormenting the country since the
40s, it is more than astonishing to find that the people themselves are
very open and friendly. The lush green on the countryside and the
amazing beaches on the coasts, mixed with some really high mountain
peaks allow for a variety you will not find in many other countries.
Finally, as it is next to the equator, the climate is almost all year
round the same: warm and mostly sunny (well, Bogotá is at 2,600 ASL, so
bring a warm jacket for the capital...).</p>
<p>The current president, Uribe, is sending military forces everywhere in
the country to protect the civilians and tourists from attacks from
guerilla and paramilitary groups. Although you might not agree that this
is the best solution to the problem, you have to admit that he so far is
probably the most successful president in terms of restoring relative
security - at the great price of sacrificing the peoples personal
freedom, obviously; Colombia probably never has been as safe in the past
few decades as it is now - and it has by far less hostage-takings per
year as most uninformed people would make you believe (by now, something
below 600 per year). In my travels, I never felt more unsafe than in any
place in Europe - at least if you learn to ignore that at every second
corner you see a small group of military personnel or police.</p>
<p>Both major cities I visited, Bogotá and Cartagena, are really nice
cities - although the crazy traffic and taxi drivers in Bogotá can make
you feel a little ill to you stomach... Especially Cartagena is really
worth the visit, the old town being built in a style slightly similar to
the houses in Extremadura (Spain) - and not without reason probably,
as most Conquistadores came from this region of Spain. Yet, the bright
colors and plenty of flowers and green give the town a very unique and
lovely look. Last but not least, Cartagena is on the Caribbean coast and
therefore you have plenty of wonderful beaches to choose to spend your
day. On a general advice: usually, you take boats to get to those
beaches, which leave from the town center. Insist, really, to be taken
there by a tiny private boat (not more than 20 or so passengers) and do
not take one of the big ships: it cuts your beach stay in half, you are
dumped at a super-touristic aquarium nobody seemed interested in anyway,
and spend the boat time with hundreds of Colombian families (including
everything from grandmother to great-grand child). Not that it was my
worst experience ever, but there are more fun ways to waste your time...</p>
<p>The major part of our travels - with my [now (*kiss*)] girlfriend
Mayte and two of her friends from Portugal and Spain, Xana and Ivan - we
spent in the Amazons. It is hard to describe the experience of visiting
the jungle, but if you have been to a real desert, on top of high
mountains or glaciers, or other really strange places, you know what I
am talking about. The biodiversity is so amazing you will never be able
to go back to a zoo or botanic garden without a knowing smile on your
face. I have no idea how many different plants I saw - including the
Victoria amazonica, the largest lotus in the world - but when one of our
guides was telling us about which plant heals what while in the jungle,
I got the impression of walking though a pharmacy... The animal life is
just as amazing: alligators, snakes, birds in all varieties and kinds,
spiders, sloths, insects of all sizes, piranhas (we even caught our own
- but as far as I can tell, it took us more chicken meat to catch them
than they yielded...), even dolphins (which get a pink tint when they
hunt because of their circulation - a really unique view) - plus another
few dozen or so I have missed to list here.</p>
<p>Moving around the jungle might seem tough and dangerous at first - and
I make a bet it is, if you try to move cross-country straight through
the jungle for days. We were not intending to do that - we were moving
along the Amazonas river only - and always had at least a hut to sleep
in, with beds and mosquito nets in the most &quot;extreme&quot; cases. Most of the
time we spent in villages and towns (Leticia -&gt; Puerto Nariño [a little
jewel in the Colombian Amazons and a must visit] -&gt; Leticia/Tabatinga -&gt;
and Manaus) in hotels, where you do not even need to use mosquito nets.
The greatest danger is you doing something stupid on your own. The
interested might want an advice on what to bring, so I'd suggest to
pack:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>lots of insect repellent (we used Relec extra fuerte, about 1 bottle
[100 mL each] per person and week),</li>
<li>a light rain protection (if it rains really heavy - which it does
more or less every morning - just forget protection... this is more
against the wind and on boats),</li>
<li>some long-sleeves and long pants (protection against sun and/or while
hiking in the jungle),</li>
<li>decent (!) hiking shoes,</li>
<li>very strong sun protection (factor 40 or more - I used 60!),</li>
<li>a towel (no, this is no Hitchhikers Guide joke :-) - preferentially,
one of those micro-towels to save space and weight),</li>
<li>a flashlight,</li>
<li>a small first aid kit with antibiotics against diarrhea, pills to
dampen fever and Malaria effects (Ibuprofen 600, Malaron - just in
case - I strongly advise against taking those Malaria pills on the
trip as prevention if you do not go jungle-trekking for many days!
The side effects are rather ugly, and actually the pills only reduce
the effects of Malaria, they do not really help prevent it.),</li>
<li>Suero (salt &amp; electrolytes) powder, and a lots of it! This protects you
from dehydrating and diarrhea; My friends all laughed at me for
drinking a liter of it a day (it tastes rather ugly), but I was the
only of our group to not have to spend a day on the pot in the end...</li>
<li>a very light (I used silk) sleeping bag, and</li>
<li>something to pass time (books, card games, etc. - hey, it's Colombia,
no need to be in a hurry).</li>
</ul>
<p>On a final shout-out: many thanks to my amazing travel companions (aka
&quot;los pendejos/tottos&quot;...) and some very special ones to the most
gorgeous girl in the world that I am more than just happy to have become
close with during this trip: You provided me with one of the most
exciting trips I ever have made in my life!</p>

                    <p>If you don't know what <a class="reference external" href="http://www.unep.org/geo/geo4">GEO-4</a> (4th Global Environment Outlook) is, it is
about high time to get you informed. This is a recent publication by the
United Nations, explaining why this planet's ecosystem and the human
race is close to the point of no return, facing (unavoidable)
extinction. Let's hope this is what the authors (390 scientist backed by
another 1000 reviewers) intend it to be: the final &quot;wake up call&quot; for
<strong>all</strong> of us.</p>
<p>To provide you a few facts:</p>
<p>We are currently, on a total, using 30 % more resources than earth can
provide for us; water contamination is the number 1 cause of death
worldwide; we are overfishing at a rate of 250 %; major regions of the
world's oceans having become oxygen dead zones (i.e. lifeless); in
Africa, food production over the past 20 years has declined by more than
10 %; somewhere between today and 2100 we will have reached a global
warming level which will lead to inevitable (&quot;point of no return&quot;)
extinction of the ecosystem (i.e. incl. humanity) - oh well, I could go
on... this report is approx. 400 pages! The only positive news I could
mine: at least the ozone layer will be recovering - although currently,
the Antarctic hole is still growing, being larger today than ever
before. The real message behind all this:
<strong>We have to act *now*!</strong></p>
<p>One last warning: this might be the most depressing news you ever
encountered, yet also the most important if you were not aware of these
facts (I surely wasnt aware of that many....)</p>

                    <p>As it is still summer time here in Madrid (well, at least for us
northern foreigners), I just enjoyed a all-night open air DJing event in
t-shirt and short pants this weekend. Remember this is Madrid, so
nothing ended before the sun chased us away! It also was the first time
I saw Massive Attack live, which turned out to be quite cool. They're
not so much about an energetic performance, but you could imagine them as
a mixture of Pink Floyd-ish showcasing and a De Phazz-like Mary Jane
atmosphere... Anyway, great concert with about 50k visitors in a full
arena. I even liked Sven Väth - but only only because I was standing
next to a wall for his performance, so his BPMs were doubled by the
wall's echo... Oh, and if you like slightly harder beats (they had tons
of good old hardcore samples in their mixes), put you ears on Vitalic, at
least live they rock! Another unknown tip and quite impressive was
Digitalism. Have phun listening!</p>

                    <p>In the last few weeks I had been to Cadiz and Almeria, both in
the south of Spain. Well, actually I was in none of those cities, but in
places close by.</p>
<p>The first trip together with Gema was down to Cadiz, about 30 km south
of the city some of Gemas friends were renting a flat in <a class="reference external" href="http://maps.google.es/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Conil,+Spain&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=11&amp;om=1">Conil</a>, a
village nearby. South of Cadiz you basically find the probably most
beautiful beaches of Spain, at least that was my impression and what my
Spanish friends told me (and, on a side note, the most incredible amount
of beautiful girls, too...). The only downside is that it can be kind of
windy, but if you know it, just bring some very stable wind protection,
and you should be fine. Actually, the one day it was windy, I was quite
happy, because with the burning sun having a swim and then cooling in
the breeze is a real relief. We also visited Tarifa, one of the main
wind- and kite surfing sites of Europe. You never saw a village so small
just full of surf shops - if you ask me, more dense than the skiing
shops in the tourist-trap villages in Tirol. Also we spent some time in
Los Caños de Meca, right between Conil and Tarifa, which is a real hippy
town and has a cool bar which is made up a bit like a ship deck and is
above a cliff looking out over the Atlantic. Great place to have some
&quot;copas&quot; (drinks)! On our way back to Madrid we took the time to stop in
Cordoba, which might be, together with Sevilla, the hottest (in
temperature, man!) town of Spain. In the center you can visit an
enormous (like in really enormous) mosque, as Cordoba and Granade where
interchangeably the capitals of the Arabian empire during the medieval
ages. Now it houses several (!!!) churches inside and it is really worth
paying the 8 Euros entry. Gema was slightly angry about my cultural
blasphemy, as the first thing that came to my mind upon entering was
&quot;and where is Indiana Jones?&quot;...</p>
<p>The second trip to Almeria in the southeast corner of Spain was
actually for a festival, the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.creamfields-andalucia.com/">Creamfields</a> in Spain. This festival is
exclusively for electronic music, and the lineup were bands and DJs like
Basement Jaxx, The Prodigy, or John Digweed. It's a 14 h festival
&quot;only&quot;, starting at 6 pm and lasting until about 8 am the next morning.
But believe me, that was by far enough for me, and it took me several
days to recover... The greatest thing about this location is that you
have the After Hour right smack on the beach, hanging out in the sun and
taking an occasional bath to cool down. Although it was great, I am not
sure to recommend it again: This year they had 50k visitors, and the
only access is a single little road, which meant we were jamming 2 1/2 h
in the car just to get in, and then another 1/2 h walk from the parking
place to the actual festival. Considering that they have more attendees
every year, I don't want to know how bad it will be next year. So if you
feel like going, I might recommend you come a day earlier and put up
tent there on the beach (actually, better in the wood at the side of the
beach - if you can't imagine why, just do as I recommend...).</p>
<p>So, all in all, two really gorgeous trips around Spain, and I am
looking forward to some more in the days to come this year. The only
thing I could slap my ass for is that I on both occasions forgot to
bring my camera...</p>

                    <p>Just now again, I stumbled across one of these mind-numbing blog posts
telling you what makes a &quot;good&quot; - sometimes even &quot;great&quot; - programmer.
As always, it went on about programming before college, having
programmed in private, knowing all sorts of technologies, being witty
and intelligent, etc. etc. etc.. Google it, you'll find dozens of such
articles. On those standards I would be a great programmer, as I usually
fit almost any point on such ridiculous lists, just as most of us
programmers do to a certain extent, and for sure after some time in the
programming biz. First of, I do NOT consider myself a &quot;great
programmer.&quot; Why? Because I have actually worked alongside truly great
programmers. Also, I have worked with many a programmer, yet I still do
not even need all fingers of one hand to count up all &quot;great ones.&quot; So
what makes up a great programmer? Actually, you can sum it up to three
quintessential points, in increasing degree of difficulty: A good
programmer...</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>...knows his interface.</li>
<li>...can communicate his work to anyone.</li>
<li>...surpasses the time and space constraints of a project.</li>
</ol>
<p>To make this a bit more clear: (1) pertains to all HCI
(human-computer-interface) related stuff like OS, IDE, or keyboard (!);
but also libraries, tools, and the knowledge of at least one programming
language close to the skill level of writing the API for it. There is no
need for somebody knowing several languages, if he can't handle at least
one really well. (2) Is about his ability to discuss the needs,
problems, requirements, etc. with his boss, a client, or a fellow mate
at just the right level of technical detail and conciseness necessary.
The third point finally is the most important of all, and usually never
even gets mentioned in most of these page-filling &quot;what makes a good
programmer&quot;-lists, much to my amusement (and is the main reason why I
just had to blog this...). This point implies, a great programmer is
capable of telling you how long his job will take (or at least will
conclude that he cannot make - for good reasons - a true estimate and
will know how to &quot;bet on the safe side&quot;), and he will then finish that
job by that estimate. Also, the way he has designed and implemented the
program will be such that others can follow as long as they have the
technical background (&quot;best practices&quot;, etc.), and will have all
interfaces and crucial nodes developed in a style which requires minimal
and necessary (i.e., optimal) documentation. Of these space and time
constraints (deadline, design, implementation, and documentation) all
will be fulfilled, and at least one of them will surpass what one was
expecting when the project started. I'd say it is usually the toughest
aspect making up great programmers.</p>
<p>I know that almost all guys saying they're &quot;good programmers&quot; (just
because they're too many) fail at least two of these three requirements,
and I freely admit I have my weaknesses in some of them and therefore do
not consider myself in the top league (hey, I'm working on it ;)); but
at least I realize those are the guys pulling of the great stunts; not
the ones who started programming at age ten, do it sixteen hours a day,
and know &quot;all&quot; about twenty different IT technologies (believe me, you
just can't...). We all are somewhat like this at certain points in time,
but the great ones got the above three points right, and especially
those three; That's what makes them uniquely different. So, please stop
glorifying your enthusiasm with stupid post on what makes &quot;great&quot;
programmers, but really only showing what nerds you are. Thank you!</p>

                    <p>As everyone has one, I just thought I might as well also put together
my personal list of the most useful applications for your nifty Mac
running the one and only truly user-friendly, working windowed OS: X!
The lists are ordered by importance, some apps are non-free, but I
explain why I use them and why you might want to as well.</p>
<div class="section" id="system-tools">
<h2>System Tools</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/">Quicksilver</a> - application launcher, action and command window -
THE most important app to have on any Mac, just get it (and learn to
use it...).</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://free.abracode.com/cmworkshop/">OnMyCommand</a> - custom right click context menus. Great tool, I use
it for a tons of stuff from SVN repository interaction, file settings
and archiving, to things like &quot;select a Madrid address to
automatically open the location in Google maps&quot; or &quot;translate the
selected text to English/Spanish.&quot;</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://cyberduck.ch/">Cyberduck</a> - is a great FTP/SFTP client, if you need one - and
definitely more elegant than using Finder...</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="editors">
<h2>Editors</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://aquamacs.org/">Aquamacs</a> - is the one-in-all solution and my favorite emacs port
for the Mac. Although, I only use it for LisP and C programming now,
as I have TextMate (see below) for my Python and web development as
well as simple text editing.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.uoregon.edu/%7Ekoch/texshop/">TexShop</a> - is the most comfortable WYSINWYG (what you see is NOT
what you get...) editor for LaTeX, which is the most reliable and
stable environment to write books and papers. Yet, you naturally just
can keep editing your TeX in emacs/Aquamacs...</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.macromates.com/">TextMate</a> - editor is kinda cool in some senses, but has some
drawbacks: first, it ain't free - I have it because my research
institute bought a license for me without even asking. It doesn't
know LisP and C. Most features it has you can have with emacs or (if
things would come to worst) write them with ELisP for emacs instead
of learning the TM macro commands. Yet, some things are kinda cool,
especially the filebrowser and codebrowser I prefer over the emacs
Speedbar. It is great for Python, Ruby, XML, Perl, JavaScript and SVN
interaction (if you are damned to program Java, use Eclipse...). So
that, incredibly fast startup, and decent column selection (you can
have that in emacs with a plug, too!) are my reasons for using it. If
you are willing to spend the bucks, get it. If you want an all-in-one
solution stick with some emacs.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="getting-things-done">
<h2>Getting Things Done</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.barebones.com/products/yojimbo/">Yojimbo</a> - if you are only willing to spend money on just one
single application, this is it. This is sort of a multi-functional
archiver: it stores your serial numbers, passwords, credit card
details, invoices, interesting documents, webpages and pdfs, the
metro plan of your city - whatever, you name it. Stuff is properly
encrypted using AES for protection. You can sort, tag, file your
content in a very decent way and you actually get to immediately find
the information again. This thing should be standard in any OS X
distribution, makes life so much simpler.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://journler.com/">Journler</a> - is a nice diary to keep track of what you are doing and
your ideas about it. I use it as my development diary (&quot;lab journal&quot;
would be the term, I guess...). You can add all sorts of media to
your entries (videos, sound (voice recordings!), images) and even
upload your entries to your blog. Cool!</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://bargiel.home.pl/iGTD/">iGTD</a> - yet another GettingThingsDone client - if you are in a
situation like me and have 10k things in your head and another 10k
todos, this is what helps you keeping track of what's next.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.apple.com/iwork/keynote/">Keynote</a> - from the iWork package; if you need to do presentations:
please do not try to infest your gorgeous Mac with crap software from
Redmond. Do your presentations with Keynote - their just better,
nicer and more aesthetic.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="media">
<h2>Media</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/">VideoLANClient (VLC)</a> - the media player for the Mac: no more
problems with missing audio/video codes, plays (almost) everything
and allows full screen for free (a two thumbs down on QuickTime for
this one!).</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.getdemocracy.com/">Democracy</a> - player, the most fun way to handle, download and
archive your video collection from YouTube, Yahoo! and Google Video,
Blogdigger, et al. as well as any clips, vids and movies you have
locally. Supports full screen viewing for free (as opposed to
QuickTime...), but ain't as versatile with codecs as VLC - but you
can teach Democracy to launch those vids in VLC.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/download/">iTunes</a> - is a must have if you own an iPod (or, eventually, an
iPhone...). If not, it is still the coolest way to keep track of your
podcasts, radio stations and browse your local MP3s (covers).</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/iphoto/">iPhoto</a> - should come with your Mac anyway AFAIK. The most
practical way of staying on top of your ever-growing picture and
image collection while integrating nicely with other apps (like
Keynote, Journler and many others).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="safari-plugins">
<h2>Safari Plugins</h2>
<p>If you are just such a Cocoa-fan as me, and prefer browsing with
Safari over Firefox (yes, OK, decent web development can only be done
with the fox, so you do need it anyway in this case...) here are some
plugs. There are some reasons to use Safari: integrates websites from
your Address Book into your Bookmarks, your bookmarks are system-wide
searchable, you can aggregate feeds very nicely, pushing URLs (weblocs)
to other apps is easy are just some. UPDATE: now back to the Fox again,
the plugins for it just rule! UPDATE (2008): and to Safari - high-speed,
nicest rendering of all browsers and WebKit rule even more!</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.kottke.org/05/02/saft-safari-plugin">Saft</a> - is the only plugin I can recommend to buy. And if only for
the full screen mode. This is just so much cooler than even the
crappy IExploder 7 full screen mode, as it actually intelligently
hides what you do not want to see currently (status bar, booksmarks,
URL bar). Naturally, it has tons of other features, too - check it
out.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.inquisitorx.com/safari/">Inquisitor</a> - is the coolest enhancement for the (Google) search
box and possibly the best free plugin. Just get it.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://pimpmysafari.com/plugins/safariblock-112">SafariBlock</a> - is a good way to block images, popups and frames you
don't wanna see. Not as powerful as Pith or Saft, but a free
alternative.</li>
</ul>

                    </h2>
                    
                    <p>Actually, when I decided to move to Spain I would never have thought of
skiing here. There are the Pyrenees, where you could expect some areas,
but I was not expecting anything anywhere else. Meanwhile, I have been
skiing in Asturias (north, center) and Sierra Nevada (south, with a view
of Africa!)... Especially the latter was quite convincing: a large skiing
area with a lot of people who can actually ski (for Tyrolean standards
quite hard to achieve!). Just thought it would be kind of crazy to be
skiing end of March in Spain, while having a glimpse at Africa and
enjoying almost 20 ˚C in the &quot;valley&quot; (that is, Granada).</p>
<p>While I am at it: Granada is quite a beautiful town, and naturally there
is the Alhambra to visit (but I did not enter: you have to reserve at
least 2 months ahead if you want to get in...). There are more foreigners
here than in Madrid, naturally, and it seems to have slightly less extreme
temperatures than the capital. Nice place to live, I guess: 1 hour for
skiing, 1 hour to the beach!</p>
<p>In summary, there are 3 decent areas for skiing in Spain: the Pyrenees,
Asturias and Granada/Sierra Nevada. I have not seen the first, but
everybody tells me it is the best place. Anyway, I'd say Granada is
definitely the fanciest and worth a visit, too. And then you can ski on
about any other mountain range here, too (e.g., Gredos, Guadarrama, etc.),
but for my taste, the slopes there are not quite as steep and long as I'd
like them.</p>
