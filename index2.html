                    <p>Out of my strong opinions about privacy, I avoid the total exposure of my private life to governmental organizations and trans-national cooperations that you (maybe unconciously) subdue yourself by owning a &quot;smart&quot; phone and storing your whole life's data in the Cloud.
And no, I am not being paranoid: There is hard evidence for the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zeit.de/digital/datenschutz/2011-03/data-protection-malte-spitz/seite-1">tracking</a> (<em>and</em> now [EDIT in 2013] the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/prism">sniffing</a>) going on - <a class="reference external" href="http://www.onread.com/book/Brave-New-World-191056/">Huxley</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.george-orwell.org/1984">Orwell</a> didn't even scratch the surface of what was to come…
So don't waste your time trying to &quot;Whats-App&quot; me or convince me to contribute content to &quot;people monitoring&quot; (social network) sites.
On top of all that, it frightens me to see - in restaurants and bars, at dinner tables at home, or in any other place people normally would talk to each other - more and more people turn into &quot;Matrix dummys&quot; that rather stare at their gadget than actually interact with each other.</p>

                    </h2>

                    <p>I just had a rough time figuring out how to bypass all the security
features of the Rails project I am developing to write decent controller
specs with RSpec. I am using AuthLogic as authentication module and
declarative authorization (DA) for exactly that. However, when I started
to write controller specs that would simulate (HTTP) GET requests, I ran
into a wall: I simply could not digg what the cleanest way would be to
bypass both AuthLogic and DA. Finally, after finding the right queries
in Google, I managed to get the necessary snippets. To avoid that the
same tedious task might befall you, here's what you need to add, e.g.,
to your spec_helpers directory - I called the file
&quot;controller_helpers.rb&quot;:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
module SessionHelper
  def current_user(stubs = {})
    &#64;current_user ||= mock_model(User, stubs)
  end

  def user_session(stubs = {}, user_stubs = {})
    &#64;current_user_session ||= mock_model(
      UserSession, { :user =&gt; current_user(user_stubs) }.merge(stubs)
    )
  end

  def login(session_stubs = {}, user_stubs = {})
    UserSession.stub!(:find).and_return(
      user_session(session_stubs, user_stubs)
    )
  end

  def logout()
    &#64;user_session = nil
  end

  def disable_authorization()
    Authorization.ignore_access_control(true)
  end
end
</pre>
<p>The trick is that, for AuthLogic, you can now &quot;authenticate&quot; the user
by the stubbed UserSession that returns a mocked User model. DA is less
complicated: the <tt class="docutils literal">disable_authorization()</tt> method is all that is
needed. Now, in your &quot;spec_helper.rb&quot;, you add this line to the top:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
require File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/spec_helpers/controller_helpers'
</pre>
<p>And this line somewhere in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Spec::Runner.configure</span></tt> loop:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
config.include(SessionHelper)
</pre>
<p>Now, in your controller specs, it is more than trivial to disable
authorization and authentication at once - simply add the following
line, e.g., to your <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">before(:each)</span></tt> definitions:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
disable_authorization &amp;&amp; login
</pre>
<p>Voila - your GET requests pass; and you can even add stubs to your
User model, if needed, by adding them as key-value pairs to the
<tt class="docutils literal">login()</tt> call above! So now you can get back to make your specs
pass...</p>

                    </h2>

                    <p>I now have tested MobileMe, SugarSync, and DropBox for quite a while to
decide which service to buy for syncing my “electronic life” between my
Macs (soon I’ll be managing two OSX Server blades, one Mini, and two
MBPs!). After this period, there is no doubt to me: I’m syncing my iCal
calendars and Address Book content via Google, my bookmarks with XMarks,
and everything else via DropBox.</p>
<p>MobileMe’s iDisk is nothing more than a pain and a piece of junk, which
I honestly did not expect. After all the problems they had last year
launching Me.com, I thought they would have by now created a working
service. But the iDisk and syncing my PIM (Personal Information Manager
- I still use Yojimbo, as Evernote’s and Together’s handling of
encryption are pure patched add-ons) was just a [bad] joke: You even
need to buy extra software if you want to do file syncing, as iDisk’s
“offline” sync is so slow and error prone I could not believe Apple
dares to offer something like that. So you need to either use Lingon and
rsync to sync to your online mode iDisk which doesn’t win a medal for
simplicity, or buy something like ChronoSync - and that takes hours
(!!!) to ensure 10 GB of data in about 30-40k Files are synced, <strong>every
time</strong>. All the more, ChronoSync may be the fastest and safest syncer in
the wild! What finally got me mad was the sync agent using 90% CPU all
of the time, at times virtually locking you out of your own machine,
while performing almost nothing. Finally, if you ever try to navigate
that online iDisk, get yourself a cup of tea, you will have plenty of
time to drink it up until that file is open…</p>
<p>Compared to SugarSync, DropBox with its simplicity and real versioning
of files is significantly better performing than SugarSync, espcially if
we talk upload and real volume, and if you ever tried SugarSync, it is a
resource hugger (not as bad as iDisk, but it will stop your workflow).
So in the end the choice for me was based on “mutual exclusion”, there
is simply still no service that can hold the candle to DropBox - and
just got me Pro account. As I am writing this, I am syncing up dozens of
gigs of data to my 50 GB DropBox, and I hardly notice it happening!</p>
<p>Oh, if you get yourself an account for DropBox, either the free 2 GB or
a full Pro account, I would appreciate if you register via <a class="reference external" href="https://www.getdropbox.com/referrals/NTE0NTA0OTk">this link</a>,
as it creates me some 500 MB extra space for referring you :o).</p>
